<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite> is a collection of Journals, Narratives,
and Memoranda relating to the life of Prince Charles
Edward Stuart at and subsequent to the Jacobite Rebellion of
1745. The formation of this collection was to a great extent
the life-work of the Rev. Robert Forbes, M.A., Bishop of
Ross and Caithness.</p>

<p>He was the son of Charles Forbes, a schoolmaster in the
parish of Rayne, Aberdeenshire, and of Marjory Wright, and
was born there in 1708, his baptism being recorded in the
parochial register as having taken place on 4th May of that
year. He must have been a studious youth, as he was sent to
Marischal College, Aberdeen, in or about 1722, at the early
age of fourteen, and graduated there as Master of Arts in
1726. He then proceeded to qualify himself for orders in the
Scottish Episcopal Church, and coming to Edinburgh in June
1735, he was there ordained priest by Bishop Freebairn. In
December of that year he became assistant to the Rev.
William Law at Leith, and soon afterwards, at the request
of the congregation, was appointed his colleague. At Leith,
it may be said, he lived and laboured for the remainder of
his life.</p>

<p>Like most of the Episcopalians of that day, he was an ardent
Jacobite, indeed one of the most ardent, and but for a timely
interposition of the 'hated Hanoverian' government would
not improbably have shared the fate of some of his brethren
whose end he chronicles. In that case there would have been
no <cite>Lyon in Mourning</cite>, and it is but fair to say that though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
<cite>The Lyon</cite> can never be considered, and does not pretend to
be, an impartial relation of the events with which it deals, our
literature of the Rebellion of 1745 would have been greatly
the poorer by its absence. Nay, it may even be said that, but
for the continuous energy and single-eyed purpose of Bishop
Forbes in this work, much of what is now known on this subject
would never have come to light.</p>

<p>On hearing of the advent of Prince Charles Edward in the
West Highlands, Mr. Forbes, with two Episcopalian clergymen
and some other gentlemen, started off with the intention
of sharing his fortunes, but all were arrested on suspicion at
St. Ninians, near Stirling, and imprisoned. He notes the fact
in the Baptismal Register of his congregation, as follows: 'A
great interruption has happened by my misfortune of being
taken prisoner at St. Ninian's, in company with the Rev.
Messrs. Thomas Drummond and John Willox, Mr. Stewart
Carmichael and Mr. Robert Clark, and James Mackay and
James Carmichael, servants, upon Saturday, the seventh day of
September 1745, and confined in Stirling Castle till February
4th, 1746, and in Edinburgh Castle till May 29th of said year.
We were seven in number, taken upon the seventh day of the
week, the seventh day of the month, and the seventh month of
the year, reckoning from March.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> An incident of the roping
of these prisoners at their removal from Stirling to Edinburgh
is narrated by the author.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>After his release from imprisonment Mr. Forbes appears to
have been invited to reside in the house of one of the most
wealthy members of his congregation, Dame Magdalene Scott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Lady Bruce of Kinross, the widow of Sir William Bruce of
Kinross. She resided in the Citadel of Leith, and was a strong
Jacobite; Mr. Forbes tells how her house was on more than
one occasion the special object of the Government's concern, as
the Prince himself was supposed to be concealed there.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For
this lady Mr. Forbes cherished the highest esteem, speaking of
her as 'the worthy person, the protection of whose roof I
enjoy.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> She died in June 1752, aged 82; but before that
event took place he had left her house, on the occasion of his
marriage to his first wife, Agnes Gairey. This was in 1749,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and the lady died on 4th April of the following year.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He
afterwards married, as his second wife, Rachel, second daughter
of Ludovick Houston of Johnstone, in Renfrewshire, of whom
he makes frequent mention in <cite>The Lyon</cite>. She was in fullest
sympathy with her husband's Jacobite proclivities, and occasionally
sent presents to the Prince abroad.</p>

<p>In 1762 Mr. Forbes was chosen and appointed Bishop of
Ross and Caithness, and in 1767 he was elected Bishop of
Aberdeen by a majority of the local clergy, but the College of
Bishops disallowed the election in his case, and another was
appointed. How keenly Mr. Forbes felt this action will be
seen from his conversation and correspondence with Bishop
Gordon of London. He twice visited his diocese in the north,
and kept full journals of his progresses.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> They are similar to
a diary of his visit to Moffat, which is inserted in <cite>The Lyon</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and which was doubtless so inserted because of its concern with
certain Jacobite matters; but it is also of interest on other
accounts.</p>

<p>In later life, when, from having less to chronicle, he
was not so taken up with this work, Bishop Forbes was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
occasional contributor to the <cite>Edinburgh Magazine</cite>, in which
he published a number of topographical and antiquarian
articles. Several of these, relating to Roslin Chapel, were
collected and printed in 1774, under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i> of
<em>Philo-Roskelynsis</em>. He died at Leith on 18th November
1775 and was buried in the Maltman's Aisle in South Leith
parish church. He does not appear to have had any children.</p>

<p>The origin of this collection, <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite>, probably
dates from the author's imprisonment in Stirling Castle
or Edinburgh Castle. In the latter place he was brought into
contact with some of those who had taken an active share in
the cause of Prince Charles, and it was, doubtless, while listening
to their narratives that he was inspired with the idea of
committing them to writing. Why he called his collection
by the name it bears, he nowhere explains. It has been
suggested that it was 'in allusion to the woe of Scotland for
her exiled race of princes;' the Lyon being the heraldic representative
of the nation. Bishop Forbes, in his own mind,
no doubt, identified the Scottish nation with the comparatively
few Jacobites within the country.</p>

<p>But whatever may be said about the title, the Bishop's purpose
was, as he declared, to make up 'a Collection of Journals
and other papers relative to the important and extraordinary
occurrences of life that happened within a certain period of time,'
and which, he adds, 'will serve to fix a distinguishing mark
upon that period as a most memorable æra to all posterity....
I have,' he proceeds to say, 'a great anxiety to make the
Collection as compleat and exact as possible for the instruction
of future ages in a piece of history the most remarkable and
interesting that ever happened in any age or country.' Nor
was it only what particularly concerned that 'certain <span class="smcap">Young
Gentleman</span>' (as they were wont to style the Prince) that Bishop
Forbes set himself to gather information, but also whatever
could be gleaned about those who followed his fortunes. He
was even desirous that every act of kindness performed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
victorious Hanoverians towards their vanquished enemies,
should be cherished with the names of the doers, that they
with the others 'may be carefully recorded and transmitted to
posterity, according to truth and justice.'</p>

<p>And thus, though it be a purely Jacobite Collection, it is
evident throughout that the author was most scrupulous with
regard to the truth of the facts he relates. Hence, in seeking
for narratives of the different episodes in the rebellion, his
endeavour was to get them at first-hand from participators
therein. 'I never chuse,' he says, 'to take matters of fact at
second-hand if I can by any means have them from those who
were immediately interested in them.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Where this could
not be obtained, he instructed his correspondents to 'have a
particular attention to dates, and to names of persons and
places;' for, he adds,'I love a precise nicety in all narratives
of facts, as indeed one cannot observe too much exactness in
these things.... I love truth, let who will be either justified
or condemned by it.... I would not wish to advance a falsehood
upon any subject,' not even on Cumberland himself, for
any consideration whatsoever.</p>

<p>His assiduity in the work is likewise noteworthy. Assuming
that he began collecting in the end of 1746, by September
1747 he records that he has covered between twenty-four and
thirty sheets, which by 19th April following had increased to
about forty, by 4th July 1748, to sixty sheets, and by the
following month about seventy, which he had bound up in
several octavo volumes. These (from the point at which he
mentions this<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>) would be at this time four in number, for
by 'sheets,' Bishop Forbes means a sheet of paper which,
when folded, yields sixteen pages, and the number of pages in
these first four volumes amount in the aggregate to 868 pages.
He was now well advanced with another, the fifth, which ends
with page 1112. The sixth volume is also dated on its title-page
'1748,' volume seventh, 1749, and volume eighth, 1750.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
This eighth volume, however, could only have been begun in
that year, as there is reference in it, near the end, to an event
which happened in 1761. But as the seven volumes contain
1598 pages, or, as the author would have put it, ninety sheets,
we have a pretty fair estimate of his diligence in the collecting,
sometimes drafting, and in all cases transcribing his materials.
Naturally, as the main facts of the Rebellion receded from
public view by the progress of time and other events, interest
would abate, and materials fall off, and this is evident enough
from the compilation of volume eighth taking ten or eleven
years, while the previous seven were accomplished in three or
four. Volume ninth, again, gave the collector employment for
at least fourteen years, for though it is dated in 1761, it contains
correspondence down to April 1775. This volume, while
it yields a few papers respecting the Rebellion of 1745, is
chiefly occupied with a correspondence maintained by Bishop
Forbes with other Jacobites, in which a most lively interest is
taken in the daily life and affairs of Prince Charles on the
Continent of Europe, and schemes suggested and devised for
the realisation, some time or other, of Jacobite hopes. This
correspondence is continued in the tenth and last volume,
which, however, is only partly filled up, the rest of the volume
consisting of blank pages. It was commenced in 1775, and goes
on to October of that year, the death of Bishop Forbes occurring
in the following month. Here, however, there is no lack of
interest in the persons to whom we are introduced as engaged
in the Cause along with Bishop Forbes. They are almost all
Episcopalians. Indeed, the members of the Scottish Episcopal
body were practically identified with the Stuart Cause from
the Revolution onwards, until in despair, they, by a formal
declaration, professedly severed themselves from it in or about
1780. Bishop Forbes did not live to see this, but even some
time before his death evil tidings had frequently arrived and
given rise to sad forebodings of shattered hopes, and the
wrecking of long-cherished expectations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>
<p>To publish his Collection, Bishop Forbes could never be
induced. He rightly judged it imprudent to print what could
only be construed as a censure of the Government of the day,
and which, accordingly, was likely to draw resentment not
only upon himself, but upon any of the surviving actors whose
names it was his desire to immortalise in story. Urged to it
by one of his correspondents (Dr. John Burton of York, who,
being himself a sufferer on the Prince's account, published a
pamphlet narrative of the Prince's adventures and escape, and
also of his own sufferings), Bishop Forbes always replied that he
'waited a seasonable opportunity.' His mind, as to this, further
appears from the way in which he expresses himself to a brother
in office in reference to Dr. Burton's publication. It has made
its appearance, he says, 'contrary to my earnest and repeated
remonstrances. I have resisted many solicitations, and I am
well aware that this is far from being a proper time for the
publication of truths of so much delicacy and danger, and
therefore, for my part, I am resolved to wait for a more seasonable
opportunity;' and when that would occur he could not
imagine. This was in 1749, and, as the result shows, the
opportunity never came for him. He did print a short account
of the Prince's adventures at a later date, copies of which he
sent to the Prince and others abroad; but this was only a trifle
in comparison with what he had collected.</p>

<p>Naturally, <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite> was one of his most
valued possessions, and he guarded it with the most jealous
care. Only on one occasion would he allow it out of his own
hands. He would show his friends the external bulk of it, but
they were not permitted to pry within. One young relative,
who did not apparently stand very high in the author's favour,
had the temerity to ask that the 'black-edged volumes' might
be sent to him in London for completing a narrative which he
and another were preparing for publication, and in reply got
the rebuff, that there was much room for doubting his competency
for the task he had undertaken, while as for the loan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
of the Manuscript, he had asked what the author would not
have granted to his own father. However, Bishop Forbes
judged it expedient to part with them for a time when his
residence was threatened with a search. He had this to plead
as an excuse to Dr. Burton, who begged the Bishop to furnish
from his collection some materials to make his own proposed
publication more perfect. 'I was obliged,' he replies, 'to
secret my collection, having been threatened with a search for
papers. I have therefore put my collection out of my own
custody into the keeping of a friend, where I cannot have
access to it without some difficulty, and I resolve to keep it so,
that so I may defy the Devil and the Dutch.' Indeed, this
was his usual way with it, for he writes to another, 'I keep my
collection in a concealment always, so that I am not afraid of
its being seized by enemies; and it is not every friend I allow
to see only the bulk and outside of my favourite papers.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The volumes are bound in sombre black leather, and have
their edges blackened, while around each title-page is a deep
black border. Some relics, which are, or have been, attached
to the volumes for preservation, call for some notice. They are
most numerous on the insides of the boards of the third volume.
First, there is a piece of the Prince's garters, which, says Bishop
Forbes, 'were French, of blue velvet, covered upon one side
with white silk, and fastened with buckles.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Next there is a
piece of the gown worn by the Prince as Betty Burke, which
was sent to Bishop Forbes by Mrs. MacDonald of Kingsburgh.
It was a print dress, and from this or other pieces sent the
pattern was obtained, and a considerable quantity of print
similar to it made by Mr. Stewart Carmichael, already mentioned.
Dresses made from this print were largely worn by
Jacobite ladies, both in Scotland and England, for a time.
Thirdly, there is a piece of tape, once part of the string of the
apron which the Prince wore as part of his female attire.
Bishop Forbes secured this relic from the hands of Flora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
MacDonald herself, who brought the veritable apron to Edinburgh,
and gave the Bishop the pleasure of girding it on him.
To keep company with these, another relic has been added to
this board by the late Dr. Robert Chambers, and which, consequently,
Bishop Forbes never saw. It is a piece of red velvet,
which once formed part of the ornaments of the Prince's sword-hilt,
and was obtained, as that gentleman narrates, in the
following way. On his march to England, the Prince rested on
a bank at Faladam, near Blackshiels, where the sisters of one of
his adherents, Robert Anderson of Whitburgh, served him and
his followers with refreshments. Before he departed, one of the
young ladies begged the Prince to give them some keepsake,
whereupon he took out his knife, and cut off a piece of velvet
and buff leather from the hilt of his sword. Up till 1836 at
least, this was preciously treasured at Whitburgh; and it was
from Miss Anderson of Whitburgh, of a later generation of
course, that Mr. Chambers at that time obtained the scrap
which he placed with the Bishop's relics. On the inside of the
back board of this volume are pieces of tartan, parts, respectively,
of the cloth and lining of the waistcoat which the Prince received
from MacDonald of Kingsburgh, when he relinquished
his female garb. This he afterwards exchanged with Malcolm
MacLeod for a coarser one, as it was too fine for the rôle
of a servant, which he was then acting. Malcolm MacLeod
hid the waistcoat in the cleft of a rock until the troubles
should be over; but when he went to recover it, as it had lain
there for a year, he found it all rotted, save a small piece,
which, with two buttons, he forwarded to Bishop Forbes.</p>

<p>On the inside of the back board of the fourth volume the
Bishop has had two small pieces of wood, one of which has now
disappeared. The remaining piece is about one inch long, less
than half an inch broad, and about one-eighth of an inch in
thickness. These, says the author, are pieces of that identical
eight-oared boat, on board of which Donald MacLeod, etc., set
out with the Prince from Boradale, after the battle of Culloden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
for Benbecula, in the Long Isle. The bits of wood were obtained
and sent by MacDonald of Glenaladale. Then, finally, there
are pieces of one of the lugs of the brogues or shoes which the
Prince wore as Betty Burke, stuck on the inside of the back
board of volume fifth. But the Bishop seems to have had
the brogues themselves, and he and his Jacobite friends were
wont to use them as drinking vessels on special occasions. This
was reported to the Prince, who heartily enjoyed the idea, and
remarked concerning Bishop Forbes, 'Oh, he is an honest man
indeed, and I hope soon to give him proofs how much I love
and esteem him.'</p>

<p>After the death of Bishop Forbes <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite>
remained a possession treasured by his widow for fully thirty
years, she alone knowing of what value it had been in the eyes
of her husband. With advancing years, however, she fell into
poverty, and was obliged in 1806 to part with the Collection, a
suitable purchaser having been found in Sir Henry Steuart of
Allanton, who had set himself the task of preparing 'An Historical
Review of the different attempts made to restore the
Stewart family to the throne from the Revolution in 1688 to the
suppression of the Rebellion in 1745.' Ill-health frustrated his
design, and <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite> lay past unknown and unheeded
at Allanton until it was unearthed by Dr. Robert Chambers.
He purchased it from Sir Henry Steuart, and in 1834
published a number of the papers and narratives contained in it
in his work entitled <cite>Jacobite Memoirs of the Rebellion of 1745</cite>.
On an average computation it may be said that Dr. Chambers
printed about a third part of what is contained in <cite>The Lyon</cite>,
sometimes weaving one narrative with another, in order to present
in fuller form, so far as possible, the entire history of the
Prince in his adventures. But what Dr. Chambers there gave
in the personal narratives of the contributors to <cite>The Lyon in
Mourning</cite>, and what he has written in his admirable popular
<cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, on information derived chiefly from
the same source, have but increased the desire of the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
student to have before him the complete text of <cite>The Lyon in
Mourning</cite> as it stands in the original manuscript. This desire
the present publication will gratify. The Council of the Scottish
History Society originally proposed merely to print what
Dr. Chambers had left unprinted. But consideration of the fact
just stated, and the undesirability of the reader being required
to compare two works in order to ascertain the real contents of
the <cite>Lyon</cite>, led to the resolution to print the full text of the
Bishop's manuscript, especially also as the <cite>Jacobite Memoirs</cite> is
now a somewhat scarce book.</p>

<p>Dr. Chambers bequeathed this Manuscript Collection of
Bishop Forbes to the Faculty of Advocates, Edinburgh, in
whose library it now remains. He had previously attached to
the first volume the following writing, to declare the genuineness
and history of the work:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="head">
'<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>May 5, 1847</em>.
</p>

<p>'I hereby certify that the accompanying manuscript, in ten
volumes, entitled <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite>, was purchased by me
in 1833 or 1834 from the late Sir Henry Steuart of Allanton,
Baronet, by whom I was informed that he had bought it about
thirty years before from the widow of Bishop Forbes of the Scottish
Episcopal Church, the compiler, who had died in 1775.</p>

<p>'The volume contains, in a chronological progress, many documents
and anecdotes respecting the civil war of 1745, and the
individuals concerned in it. On this account I desired to possess
it, as I designed to make use of its contents for the improvement
of a history of the insurrection which I had written.</p>

<p class="sig">
(Signed) '<span class="smcap">Robert Chambers</span>.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>By a 'chronological progress' the reader is not to understand
that the events of the Prince's life, or of the Rebellion, will be
found related in order of time in the following pages. It can
only mean that Bishop Forbes proceeded in a chronological
progress from 1746 or 1747 till his death, in building up his
Collection, telling us from time to time the dates of his receiving
his information, which he enrols as he receives it, without
any other regard to chronology than its coming to him. But
to enable the reader to follow the chronological sequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
events, a brief chronological digest of the narratives contained
in the Collection will be given as an Appendix in the third
volume. In that volume also will be found an Index to the
whole work. Into the plots and scheming prior to the actual
outbreak of the insurrection, Bishop Forbes's materials do not
lead us. It is, however, satisfactory to learn that the Scottish
History Society has in hand the publication of the Journal of
the Prince's Secretary, John Murray of Broughton, which promises
to throw light upon much that was taking place anterior
to the actual outbreak, as well as in other respects to supply
the deficiencies of <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite>.</p>

<p>It only remains to acknowledge the kindness of the Faculty
of Advocates in placing <cite>The Lyon in Mourning</cite> at the disposal
of the Society for publication, and the uniform courtesy of Mr.
Clark and his assistants in the Advocates' Library in facilitating
the progress of this work. Our acknowledgments are also
due to the indefatigable Secretary of the Society, Mr. T. G. Law,
and to his ever-willing assistants in the Signet Library, for their
ready furtherance in the labours of reference and research.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Copy</span> of a <span class="smcap">Letter</span> from the Rev. Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert
Lyon</span><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to his <span class="smcap">Mother</span> and <span class="smcap">Sisters</span>.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">1746
23 Oct.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 1.] <span class="smcap">My dear mother and my loving sisters</span>,&mdash;How ever great a
shock to nature I presently feel in writing you upon this occasion,
and the great trouble and affliction it must give you all
in reading my last, yet I could not allow myself, having warning
of my approaching fate, to leave this miserably wicked
world, without bidding you farewel and offering you my advice.</p>

<p>It has pleased Almighty God in His unsearchable Providence
for some time past to afflict me with grievous and sore troubles,
everything that could be look'd on as comfortable in this
world being denied me that was in the power of my enemies to
grant or refuse. But blessed be my merciful God, they could
not stop the inward consolations of God's Holy Spirit, which
has hitherto supported me in health and vigour under all this
miserable scene of calamities, for which I have the greatest
reason, while I live, to bless and adore His glorious name.
The miseries I have already undergone, and humanly speaking,
am still to suffer, are undoubtedly inflicted upon me as a just
reward and punishment for my manifold sins and iniquities,
[<em>fol.</em> 2.]
and I trust they have been dispensed as the chastisements of a
merciful Father to a prodigal child in order to draw me to a
nearer acquaintance with Himself, to wean my heart from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
inordinate affections to the follies and vanities of the world, to
enlarge my heart with desires of being with Jesus, my Saviour,
of the freedom from sin and of the fruition of my God to all
eternity. This is the proper influence His afflicting hand
should have had upon me. And, if my heart deceives me not,
I have made it my endeavour, tho' with a great mixture of
weakness during my long confinement, it should have its due
effect.</p>

<p>Before this will reach you (my dear mother and sisters) the
last fatal scene of my sufferings will be over and I set at liberty
(even by my enemies themselves) from the heavy load of irons
and chains I have so long drag'd. Lord, loose me from the
burden of my sins! Assist me in my last and greatest trial!
Receive my soul, and bring me into the way of eternal happiness
and joy! Grieve not for me, my dearest friends, since I
suffer in a righteous and honourable cause, but rather rejoice
that God has assisted me by His grace, the most unworthy of
[<em>fol.</em> 3.]
His servants, to act agreeably to my conscience and duty by
bearing testimony to truth and righteousness, religion and
loyalty in midst of a wicked and irreligious, perverse and
rebellious generation. Let this consideration, the motives of
Christianity, and the hopes and assurances which our holy
religion so plentifully affords, allay in you all immoderate
grief, and make you thoroughly resign'd to God's holy will in
all His wise dispensations; which howsoever harsh at present
they may appear to flesh and blood, yet they shall all be made
to work together for good to them that love and fear Him,
and put their trust in His mercy.</p>

<p>I am very sensible how much easier it is to give advice
against affliction and trouble in the case of others than to take
it in my own. It hath pleased God to exercise me of late with
very sore trials, in which I do, I think, perfectly submit to His
good pleasure, firmly believing that He does always that which
is best. And yet tho' my reason was satisfied, my passion was
not so soon appeas'd; for to do this is a work of some labour
and time.</p>

<p>But since that God hath thought fit to warn me of my own
mortality by giving me a summons to die a violent and barbarous
death by the hand of man, I thank God for it; it hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
occasion'd in me no very melancholy reflections. But this perhaps
is more owing to my natural temper than wise considerations.
[<em>fol.</em> 4.]
But yet, methinks, both reason and religion do offer
you, my dear mother and sisters, considerations of that solidity
and strength, as may very well support you under all the
afflictions of this present life. Pray then consider:&mdash;</p>

<p>That God is perfect love and goodness; that we are not only
His creatures, but His children, and as dear to Him as to ourselves;
that He does not afflict willingly nor grieve the
children of men, and that all evils of afflictions which befal us,
are intended for the cure and prevention of greater evils, of sin
and punishment. And therefore we ought not only to submit
to them with patience as being deserved by us, but to receive
them with thankfulness as being design'd by Him to do us that
good and to bring us to that sense of Him and ourselves which
perhaps nothing else would have done. That the sufferings of
this present life are but short and light compar'd with those
extreme and endless miseries which we have deserved, and with
that exceeding weight of glory which we hope for in the other
world, if we be careful to make the best preparations for death
and eternity. Whatever hardships and afflictions we suffer for
our attachment to truth and righteousness bring us nearer to
our everlasting happiness, and how rugged soever the way may
[<em>fol.</em> 5.]
be, the comfort is that it leads to our Father's house where we
shall want nothing that we can wish for.</p>

<p>But now you labour under affliction for the death and loss
of your only son, and all of you of your dearest earthly friend.
Consider then that, if you be good Christians, God who is your
best friend, who is immortal and cannot die, will never leave
you nor forsake you, but will provide both for your temporal
and spiritual concerns beyond what you can either ask or think.
But nature, you say, is fond of life. I acknowledge it. But
then consider, to what purpose should we desire a long life?
since with the usual burdens and infirmities and misfortunes
that attend it, it is but the same thing over again or worse, so
many more nights and days, summers and winters, with less
pleasure and relish, every day a return of the same and greater
pains and troubles, but perhaps with less strength and patience
to bear them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>These, and the like considerations, have under my present
calamities entertain'd me not only with contentment but comfort,
tho' with great inequality of temper at several times, and
with much mixture of human frailty, which will in some degree
stick to us while we are in this world. However by this kind
of thoughts afflictions and death itself will become more
familiar to us, and keep us from starting at the one or repining
[<em>fol.</em> 6.]
at the other.</p>

<p>I acknowledge I find in myself a great tenderness in parting
with you, my dearest relations, which I must confess doth very
sensibly touch me. But then I consider, and so, I hope, with
all of you, that this separation will be but a very little while,
and that tho' I shall leave you in a very wicked world, yet you
are all under the care of a good God who can be more and
better to you than I and all other relations whatever, and will
certainly be so to all those that love Him and hope in His mercy.</p>

<p>It likewise gives me no small uneasiness that I should leave
you in a worse way as to your worldly circumstances than I
could have wished or once expected, having spent my own and
made some encroachments upon poor Cicie's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> stock. But then
I must say in my own vindication, this was not by any luxury
or riot, as you can bear me witness, but rather owing to a small
yearly income, an expensive place for living, and being too
liberally disposed upon certain occasions; but, above all, by my
being engag'd in the late glorious cause of serving my King and
country. You'll easily see it was no mercenary view, but
purely obedience to conscience and duty that made me take
[<em>fol.</em> 7.]
part in the fate of my royal prince and country when I tell you
that I never received a farthing of his Royal Highness's money,
nor was assisted in the least penny by any engaged in his service.
So that this undertaking consum'd no small part of my
private stock; and I hope you'll readily grant it could not
have been better bestow'd, altho' all of you must feel the want
of it. But God who has formerly done wonderful things for
us all will, I trust, provide for you the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>And even poverty rightly weigh'd is not so very sad a condition.
For what is it but the absence of a very few superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
things which please wanton fancy rather than answer
need, without which nature is easily satisfied, and which, if we
do not affect, we cannot want? What is it but to wear coarse
cloaths, to feed on plain and simple fare, to work and take
some pains, to sit or goe in a lower place, to have few friends
and not one flatterer? And what great harm in this? If I
had time to compare it with the many dangers and temptations
to which wealth is expos'd,&mdash;pray consider that poverty
is a state which many have born with great chearfulness.
Many wise men have voluntarily embrac'd it. It is allotted by
Divine wisdom to most men, and the very best of men do often
[<em>fol.</em> 8.]
endure it. God has declared an especial regard to that state
of life. The mouth of truth hath proclaimed it happy. The
Son of God dignified it by His own choice, and sanctified it by
His partaking deeply thereof. And can such a condition be
very disagreeable to any of you (who were never over-prosperous
in the world)? Or can it reasonably displease you?</p>

<p>My dear mother and sisters, these considerations, I hope,
thro' the Divine assistance, will be a mean to support you
under your present and future afflictions, and preserve you
from repining at my fate and your own loss.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>[Before I end this letter I must take this opportunity to
acquaint you of one thing that none on earth knows but the
person immediately concern'd. The matter is this. Had it
pleased God that I should have surviv'd my dear mother, and
been provided of any tolerable subsistence in this world, I
design'd and propos'd to make Stewart Rose (whom I know to
be a virtuous, wise, good, and religious young woman), partner
of my life and fortune. I am too sensible of what she suffers
on my account, and which would make her affliction sit the
harder upon her, the natural modesty she is mistress of, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
never allow'd her to give vent to her grief, had not I mention'd
it to you. I therefore recommend her to you, my dear mother,
always to look upon her as your daughter, and to you, my dear
sisters, to treat her always as your own sister, she being really
so in my most serious intention and fix'd resolution. And I
am persuaded there are none of you but will bear so far a
regard to my memory as to value, esteem, and, as far as in your
power, cherish and comfort the person on whom I had so
deservedly settled my love and affection. I am sensible that
all of you esteem'd her before on your acquaintance with her
and her own proper merit, and am convinc'd that my discovering
my mind thus far will more and more increase and not
lessen your love and regard to her. May Almighty God support
and comfort her and you all, and make you with humble
submission resign'd to the Divine will.]</p>

<p>I must next acknowledge with all the tender-heartedness of
a brother, the grievous troubles and afflictions both of body
and mind my dear sister, Cicie, hath undergone, in order to be
of use and comfort to me under my severe trials. Her firm
love to me has made her follow my fate too far, and be a
witness of more of my troubles than I could have wish'd. But
whatever she has suffer'd on my account, which indeed cannot
be express'd, she has been of unspeakable service to me. May
Almighty God reward her, and whatever love all of you bore
to her formerly I hope it will be enlarged to her on this very
account.</p>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 9.] I cannot conclude without offering my best wishes (as they
have always had my prayers) to Mr. Drummond, my colleague,
and every individual person a member of our congregation.
May Almighty God bless all of them both in their temporal
and spiritual concerns, and of His infinite goodness reward
them for their love and kindness, their attachment and concern
for me in the several difficulties I have undergone! May the
same God in His due time afford them authoriz'd guides to
perform Divine offices amongst them, to administer to them
the means of grace and bread of life, that they may be no
longer as sheep without a shepherd. Till which time may the
Holy Spirit direct every one of them into the way of truth,
and assist them earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to the saints, in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in
righteousness of life. And finally, may the same merciful
Lord save them and bless them, make them to the end of their
lives stedfast in the faith, unblameable in holiness and zealous
of good works.</p>

<p>You'll be pleased to offer my hearty and sincere good wishes
to Balgowan<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and all that worthy family. I gratefully acknowledge
their remarkable and undeserved favours. May
Almighty God return them sevenfold into their bosom!</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 10.] I sincerely pray that Almighty God may reward the family
of Moncrief, Mr. Smyth's, Mr. Stirling's, Dr. Carmichael's, Mr.
Graeme's, ladies of Stormont, Lady Findal's, and all other my
kind benefactors and well-wishers with you (who have so bountifully
ministred to my necessities) with His eternal and everlasting
good things.</p>

<p>As I expect and earnestly desire forgiveness from God of all
my sins and transgressions, thro' the merits and mediation of
my only Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ, so from the very
bottom of my heart I forgive all my enemies, persecutors, and
slanderers, and particularly Clerk Millar,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who, I have reason
to believe, has prosecute me to death, and whom, to my knowledge,
I never injured in thought, word, or deed. May God
grant him repentance that he may obtain forgiveness at the
hands of our heavenly Father. And with the same earnestness
I desire all of you to forgive him, and tho' it should be in
your power, never in the least degree to resent it against him
or his.</p>

<p>And now, my dear mother and sisters, it is my dying exhortation
[<em>fol.</em> 11.]
to you, as well as to every particular person, who (by
the providence of God) was committed to my spiritual care,
stedfastly and constantly to continue in the faith and communion
of our holy persecuted mother, the Church of Scotland,
in which I have the honour to die a very unworthy priest,
whatever temporal inconveniences and hardships you may
wrestle with in so doing. Nothing must appear too hard
which tends to the salvation of your souls; and the disciple is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
not to expect better treatment than his Lord and Master.
For as they persecuted Him, even so will they persecute you.
Strenuously adhere then, in spite of all opposition, to those
doctrines and principles, which thro' the grace of God and my
own weak abilities, I endeavoured to teach publickly and inculcate
upon you in my private conversation, I mean the doctrines
of the Holy Scriptures, with their only genuine and authentick
comment, the universal doctrines and practices of Christ's
Church in her purest ages, even the three first centuries, before
the manifold errors of Popery, on the one hand, or Presbyterian
enthusiasm, on the other, prevail'd; both of which have been
dangerous to the souls of many. Let no worldly consideration
[<em>fol.</em> 12.]
prevail with any of you to join with schismaticks of whatever
kind; and more especially be not deceived by those who may
come unto you in sheep's cloathing, having the appearance of
sanctity and righteousness more than others, but in Divine
offices offer up to God unlawful petitions and immoral prayers.</p>

<p>And, as you know, the man cannot be perfectly happy without
the reunion of soul and body (in consequence of which
principle it was my practice, in my family devotions to commemorate
the souls of my deceas'd friends who died in the
Lord), so I earnestly beg and intreat when you approach the
throne of grace that you'll pray for rest and peace, light and
refreshment to my soul, that I may find mercy in the day of
the Lord, and that I may be partaker of perfect consummation
and bliss both in body and soul in God's eternal and
everlasting glory. May our good and wise ecclesiastical governours,
with the Divine assistance, contribute their endeavours
to restore this and all other primitive and apostolic practices
in due form to the publick offices of our Church, which would
be a mean to administer comfort and great consolation to
many a pious and devout soul. I cannot finish this subject
[<em>fol.</em> 13.]
without putting up my petitions in the same words of our holy
mother, the Church, as she appoints the very day<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> on which it
is determined I should suffer: 'O Almighty God, who hast
built thy Church upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the head corner-stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
grant us so to be joined together in unity of spirit by their
doctrine that we may be made an holy temple, acceptable unto
Thee through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.'</p>

<p>And now, my dear mother and sisters, I must conclude this
my too long letter with my prayers for you. May our most
gracious God pardon all your offences and correct whatever is
amiss in any of you. May He preserve you all in health,
peace, and safety, and, above all, in mutual love to one another.
May He pour down upon you His spiritual blessings, and
vouchsafe you also such a measure of temporal blessings as He
sees most convenient for you. May He of His infinite mercy
let you want nothing either for life or for godliness. I pray
God to fit us all for that great change which we must once
undergoe; and if we be but in any measure prepared, sooner or
latter makes no great difference. I commend you all to the
father of Mercies and the God of all consolation and comfort,
beseeching Him to increase your faith, patience, and resignation,
[<em>fol.</em> 14.]
and to stand by you in all your conflicts, difficulties, and
troubles, that when ye walk thro' the valley of the shadow of
death you may fear no evil, and when your heart fails you may
find Him the strength of your heart and portion for ever.</p>

<p>Farewel, my dear mother! Farewel, my loving sisters!
Farewel, every one of you for ever! And let us fervently pray
for one another that we may have a joyful and happy meeting
in another world, and there continue in holy fellowship and
communion with our God and one another, partakers of everlasting
bliss and glory to the endless ages of eternity.</p>

<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and
the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all evermore,
is the prayer and blessing of, my dear mother, your obedient
and affectionate son, and my loving sisters, your affectionate
and loving brother, while</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Last and Dying Speech of Robert Lyon,
A.M. Presbyter at Perth.</span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">28 Oct.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 15.] The death I am now to suffer by the hands of violence the
partial and unthinking world will doubtless be ready to imagine
a sign of guilt and a stain upon the character with which I am
invested.</p>

<p>But would the hardships of a close confinement and the
time permit me to explain and vindicate my principles, I am
persuaded I could prove them just and my conduct guiltless in
the things for which I am to die.</p>

<p>That I may not, however, leave a natural curiosity on such
occasions quite ungratified I shall briefly run over the principal
passages of my past life, and represent my genuine sentiments
in some material points. Which I hope will have the greater
weight and efficacy upon you, my dear fellow-subjects and
beloved countrymen, as I am just about to step into eternity
where, at the greatest tribunal, on the last day I know I must
be judged according to the works I have already done. And</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 16.] First. It will be very proper to inform you that I have the
honour to be more immediately descended from one of those
Scottish clergymen,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> who unhappily surviv'd our flourishing
Church and prosperous nation at the late Revolution; by
which means it was my lot, by the wise providence of God to be
early train'd up in the school of adversity, inasmuch as he underwent
the common fate of our other spiritual pastors and dear
fathers in Christ who were by merely secular, and what is
worse, unlawful force thrust away from their charges and
depriv'd of that maintenance to which they had a general and
divine right as well as a legal title by our Constitution. And
this in many instances was executed with the utmost rigour
and severity, attended with every wicked and aggravating circumstance.
For how could it be otherwise when allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
be done by an ungovern'd mob, distracted with enthusiasm
and misguided zeal, but whose deed received its sanction by
some subsequent pretended laws.</p>

<p>Into this once glorious but now declining part of the Church
Catholick I was thro' the care and piety of my loving parents
enter'd by a holy baptism. For which inestimable benefit, as
my judgment ripen'd and my reason improv'd I ever found
[<em>fol.</em> 17.]
greater cause to bless the happy instruments, and to thank my
God, as it clearly appeared upon impartial enquiry that this
Church for purity of doctrine, orthodoxy in the faith, perfection
of worship and her apostolical government, equals, if not
excels, any other church on the earth. And therefore I persisted
by Divine grace an unworthy member in her faithful
communion till thro' various instances of the goodness and
care of Heaven manifested in the wonderful support and preservation
of our family, I received a pious and liberal education
(tho' my father, wore out with sufferings, lived not to see
it half compleated), and at length arrived at that age when by
the canons of the Church I could be admitted into holy orders;
which I received at a time no earthly motive could influence
me, but a sincere intention to serve God and to my power to
do good offices to men.</p>

<p>Both which I, tho' most unworthy of the sacred character,
have ever honestly endeavour'd to the utmost of my weak
ability, by enforcing and practising, as far as circumstances and
my station in the Church would permit, that golden and
glorious rule for the conduct of a Christian, and for every
[<em>fol.</em> 18.]
church whereby to reform itself, and moreover which alone
can unite the differing parts of Christendom, I mean the Holy
Scriptures, with their only genuine and authentick comment,
the universal doctrines and practices of Christ's Church in her
first three centuries. Which that it may again universally
obtain God Almighty grant for his sake who purchas'd the
Church with the effusion of his blood.</p>

<p>In perfect consistency with this Catholick and noble rule I
declare upon this aweful occasion, and on the word of a dying
man, that I ever abhor'd and detested and <em>do</em> now <em>solemnly</em>
disclaim the many errors and corruptions of the Church of
Rome; as I do with equal zeal the distinguishing principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Presbyterians and other dissenting sectaries amongst us who
are void of every support in our country but ignorance and
usurping force, and whom I always considered as the shame
and reproach of the happy Reformation, and both alike uncatholick
and dangerous to the soul of a Christian.</p>

<p>I must further declare that by the same method I found out
[<em>fol.</em> 19.]
the absurdities of these two differing parties, I was soon determin'd
from rational and solid arguments to embrace the
doctrines of passive obedience, the divine right of kings, and in
particular the indefeasible and hereditary title of our own
gracious sovereign, James the Eighth and Third, and of his
royal heirs, whom God preserve and restore.</p>

<p>For these I am thoroughly convinc'd are doctrines founded
upon the best maxims of civil government and on the Word
of God; and besides the very essence of our own Constitution
and municipal laws. And therefore I could never view that
Convention which pretended to depose King James the Seventh,
our King's royal father, and dispose of his crown; I could
never, I say, view that unlawful and pack'd Assembly in any
other light but as traitors to their country and rebels to their
King.</p>

<p>And as our then injured King and his undoubted heirs have
from time to time uninterruptedly claim'd their right and
asserted their dominion, I am so far from thinking that the
[<em>fol.</em> 20.]
royal misfortunes loose the subjects from their obedience, that
I rather apprehend they loudly call for a steadier allegiance
and more faithful duty.</p>

<p>In which sentiments I have been still more and more confirm'd
by the lamentable consequences of the opposite opinion, and by
that sad affliction and load of misery, which a long usurpation has
brought upon my country and which it is needless for me here
to insist upon, as our numerous grievances, too heavy to be
born, have been strongly, but alas! in vain, represented and
loudly proclaimed even in some late pretended parliaments.</p>

<p>But what more naturally falls to my share to consider, and
what I fear has been still less regarded in the long persecuted
state of my dear mother, the Church of Scotland, that Church
of which it is my greatest honour to be a member and a priest,
tho' very undeserving of either; a Church, national and independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of any other and of every power upon earth, happily
govern'd by her own truly primitive bishops, as so many spiritual
princes, presiding in their different districts, and in them,
accountable to none but God for the administration of her
[<em>fol.</em> 21.]
discipline; a church, whose creeds demonstrate her soundness
in the faith, and who is blest with a liturgy (I mean the Scots
Liturgy,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> compil'd by her own bishops) nigher to the primitive
model than any other church this day can boast of (excepting,
perhaps, a small but I believe a very pure church in England<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
who, I am told, has lately reformed herself in concert with the
forementioned and infallible rule)&mdash;in one word a church very
nearly resembling the purest ages, and who (after more than
half a century groaning under persecutions and mourning in her
own ashes, but all the while distinguishing herself no less by
forbearance and charity to her bitterest enemies than by her
steadiness to principle and Catholick unity) is now at last,
alas! devoted, in the intention of her adversaries to utter
destruction; which I fervently pray God to prevent.</p>

<p>Her oratories have been profan'd and burnt, her holy altars
desecrated, her priests outragiously plundered and driven from
their flocks, some of them imprison'd and treated with uncommon
cruelty, her faithful members almost depriv'd of the
[<em>fol.</em> 22.]
ordinary means of their salvation, and this mostly done
without so much as a form of law, by a hostile force specially
appointed by him who calls himself the Duke of Cumberland,
and who (God grant him a timely repentance and forgive
him) has occasion'd the painful and untimely death of many
innocent and inoffensive persons; and by wilful fire and sword,
by every means of torment and distress&mdash;barbarity exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Glencoe massacre itself&mdash;has brought a dreadful desolation
upon my dear country.</p>

<p>All which evidently shews that there is nothing, however
necessary and dear to mankind, however sacred and near allied
to Heaven; that must not give way to their resentment and to
the better establishing their ill-got power, and that no lasting
security even to the present established Church of England
can reasonably be expected from this ruinous and usurped
government. And indeed the reigning impiety and that flood
[<em>fol.</em> 23.]
of wickedness which the kindly influence and encouragement of
a corrupted court has drawn upon us must speedily deface the
very form of religion and give the finishing stroke to virtue,
tho' no harsher methods were us'd by them.</p>

<p>But may the gracious hand of Heaven interpose and stop
the wide destruction! May our Church once more resume her
antient lustre, her priests be cloathed with righteousness and
her saints yet sing with joyfulness! May her members yet be
multiplied, blessed with peace and felicity in this world, and
crown'd with immortality in that which is to come!</p>

<p>And now, my dear fellow-subjects, you cannot be at a loss
to apprehend the reason of my appearance on this occasion,
and of the death I am to suffer. For when our brave and
natural-born Prince (a Prince endued with every virtue proper
to grace a throne, and a stranger to every vice that high life is
most subject to, in a word a Prince adorn'd with every quality
that could attract the hearts of a wise people or make a nation
[<em>fol.</em> 24.]
happy) generously hazarded his own valuable person to relieve
us from slavery and to retrieve his father's crown; and every
steady patriot who had courage to resolve to conquer or suffer
in the way of duty, according to the will of God, join'd his
royal standard; thither many, to whom I was attach'd by
relation, friendship and several other ties, dutyfully resorted,
and kindly invited and earnestly importun'd me to attend
them as their priest, while they were laudably engaged in
their king and country's cause; which agreeably to my now
profess'd principles I readily consented to, as I plainly foresaw
that I could not discharge my function with more safety in
that congregation to which I have a spiritual and peculiar
relation where part of the Prince's forces always lay, than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
going along with my worthy friends in their glorious expedition.</p>

<p>And here I must declare that while I accompanied my brave
[<em>fol.</em> 25.]
countrymen in their noble enterprise I saw a decency and
order maintained amongst them, equal if not superiour to any
regular disciplin'd force. And if any hardship or severity was
committed I am fully persuaded it was unknown to, and very
cross to the inclination of their merciful and royal leader.</p>

<p>And in particular I do believe that the destruction of St.
Ninian's<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> was merely by accident and without any order from
his royal highness. And this is the more evident since the
person who had the fatal occasion of it lost his own life in the
conflagration. But it was maliciously represented and put in
the worst light to vindicate the malicious procedure of the
Usurper's forces; whose conduct let it be compar'd with that
of our King's army and then you may form as ready and just a
judgment of the true and pretended father of the country, as
Solomon by a like experiment did of the true and pretended
mother of the child.</p>

<p>And for my own particular, I do solemnly affirm that during
[<em>fol.</em> 26.]
this expedition I never bore arms, for this I thought inconsistent
with my sacred character. I never prayed in express
terms for any king (because for many years it has not been the
practice of our Church, and to make such a change in her
offices I thought incompetent for me without the appointment,
or at least the permission of my superiours) and preach'd the
plain truths of the Gospel without touching on political subjects.
This confession, by surprize, and the advice of my
council I was forced to make at the Bar, upon which my pretended
judges declar'd, and the jury found me guilty of high
treason and levying war, for my barely accompanying the
royal army as before mentioned. And this their rigorous
procedure they founded upon a pretended new Act of Parliament
made since I was personally engaged in the royal cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 27.]
and for what I know since I was a prisoner: which plainly
shews that whatever my private sentiments have been my
life has been greedily sought and unjustly taken away, in
as much as they pass'd their sentence without any other overt
act of high treason (even in their own sense) being prov'd
against me.</p>

<p>But in obedience to the precept, and after the divine
example of my blessed Master, Jesus Christ, I heartily and
cheerfully forgive them, as I do all my adversaries of whatever
kind, particularly George Millar, Clerk of Perth, who, I
have reason to believe, has prosecute me to death, and whom
to my knowledge I never injur'd in thought, word, or deed.
Lord, grant him repentance that he may find forgiveness
of God.</p>

<p>And more especially I forgive the Elector of Hanover by
virtue of whose unlawful commission I am brought to this
violent and publick death, and whom I consider as my greatest
enemy, because he is the enemy of my holy mother, the Church,
of my King and of my Country.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 28.] I do here acknowledge publickly with a strong and inward
sense of guilt that thro' fear, human frailty, the persuasion of
lawyers and the promise and assurance of life, I was prevail'd
upon, contrary to the sentiments of my conscience and my openly
profess'd principles, to address the Elector of Hanover for mercy
and my life. Which address or petition or anything of that
kind I have sign'd, derogatory to the royal cause, or our undoubted
lawful sovereign's right and title, I hereby retract, and
wish from the bottom of my heart I had never done any such
thing; and with the sorrow and contrition of a dying penitent,
most humbly beg forgiveness of my heavenly Father for this
my great offence. God be merciful to me a sinner. I likewise
beg forgiveness of all those good, religious and loyal persons to
whom my inconsistent conduct in this particular has given just
[<em>fol.</em> 29.]
occasion of scandal and offence. And I humbly confess the
justice of God for bringing to nought the devices of men
when aim'd at or sought after by undue means and unlawful
methods. But hereby the unmerciful disposition of the Hanoverian
family appears the more evident, and the injustice and
cruelty of the Elector's Council at law in this, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
indicted, arraign'd, tried and condemn'd a person<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> whom I had
forc'd by a subp&oelig;na to attend my trial at Carlisle as an
exculpatory evidence, notwithstanding he had long before
delivered himself up in consequence of the pretended Duke of
Cumberland's proclamation, had obtain'd a protection and got
a pass. This the more deeply concerns me in case any of his
friends should imagine I had any design against him by forcing
him to run such a hazard. But I here call God to witness, I
esteemed the man, and as I thought him perfectly safe, I had
no other view in bringing him this length than to do myself
justice.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 30.] I farther acknowledge and humbly adore the justice of God's
holy providence, the sovereign disposer of all things, in permitting
the execution of the sentence of death against me, confiding
that He of his mercy and goodness, through the blood
and mediation of his dear and only Son, will accept of this my
suffering in the cause of truth and righteousness, and reward
it with the joys of his eternal kingdom. I heartily give thanks
to Him for vouchsafing me the honour and felicity of dying
for the sake of conscience, and of sealing with my blood those
heavenly truths I have maintain'd, particularly that of loyalty
to my king and prince.</p>

<p>And I do declare upon this aweful and solemn occasion I
feel no sting of conscience for the part I have acted in our
civil discords; and do sincerely profess before God and the
whole world that had He of his infinite wisdom thought
proper to prolong my life, I should have ever, by His all-powerful
[<em>fol.</em> 31.]
aid and grace, steadily persisted in the same faith and
principles, in the hearty and zealous belief and open profession
of which I now die, and with fervent charity to all men;
imploring the pardon and forgiveness of all my sins thro' the
merits and mediation of my crucified Saviour, our Lord Jesus
Christ; earnestly exhorting you, my dearest fellow-subjects,
and most beloved countrymen, speedily to repent and to turn
to your duty in every point, and, in particular, to that fidelity
and allegiance which you owe to your native and only rightful
sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Consider, I beseech you, consider the evils already felt, the
impending ruin of your country. Consider the crying injustice
and indignity offered to the best of princes. Above all,
consider the guilt and high demerit of violating God's laws
and resisting His ordinance. And let these powerful and prevailing
motives excite you quickly to amend your ways, to
make a thorough change in your life and conversation, and to
[<em>fol.</em> 32.]
continue for ever firm and unshaken in your duty and subjection
to the power ordain'd of God, not only for wrath, but also
for conscience sake. So shall ye arrest the vengeance and just
wrath of Heaven which has gone out against us. Ye shall be
the happy instruments yet to preserve your wishing country
from entire destruction, and save your souls in the day of the
Lord.</p>

<p>For which glorious and noble ends, Do Thou, O God
Almighty! by Thy Holy Spirit, turn the hearts of the disobedient
to the wisdom of the just, the hearts of parents to their
children, of children to their parents, the hearts of priests and
kings to their people, of people to their kings and priests, the
hearts of all to one another and all together unto Thee, their
God, thro' Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>I conclude in the words of our holy mother, the Church, as
she piously appoints in the office for this day,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and in that of
the protomartyr, St. Stephen:&mdash;</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 33.] 'O Almighty God, who has built thy church upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself
being the head corner stone, grant us so to be joined together
in unity of spirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an
holy temple acceptable unto Thee, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, Amen.</p>

<p>'Grant, O Lord, that in all our sufferings here upon earth
for the testimony of thy truth, we may stedfastly look up to
Heaven, and by faith behold the glory that shall be revealed;
and being fill'd with the Holy Ghost may learn to love and
bless our persecutors by the example of the first martyr, St.
Stephen, who prayed for his murderers, to Thee, O blessed
Jesus, who standest at the right hand of God, to succour all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
those that suffer for Thee, our only Mediator and Advocate,
Amen.'</p>

<p>Good Lord, lay not innocent blood to the charge of this
people and nation.</p>

prayers of</p>

</p>

<p>On the 18th of October Mr. Francis Buchanan of Arnprior,
after he was taken from prison return'd again and spoke to me
the following words or to the same purpose:</p>

<p>As I have obtain'd a few minutes longer to stay here I desire
to spend them with you in prayer and conversation. After
prayers he proceeded and said: I am much oblig'd to Mr.
Wilson<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (one of the clergymen belonging to the Cathedral) for
suggesting one thing which I forgot to speak of, being conscious
of my own innocence. He says my being slander'd with the
murder of Mr. Stewart of Glenbuckie<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> did me harm on my
[<em>fol.</em> 35.]
trial. Now I take this opportunity to declare publickly to you
and my fellow prisoners that Glenbuckie and I liv'd many years
in close friendship together, and altho' he was found dead in
my house, yet, upon the word of a dying man, I declare I
myself had no hand in his death, nor do I know any other
person that had. And I am persuaded I can likewise answer
for every one of my servants, since all of them were acquainted
with and had a particular love to that gentleman. So that I
declare it to be my opinion that he was the occasion of his own
death.</p>

<p class="hanging"><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;As Mr. Lyon frequently administred the holy
Eucharist to his fellow-prisoners in Carlisle Castle, so
particularly upon Wednesday, October 15th, he had the
happiness to communicate above fifty of them, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which number were Mr. Thomas Coppoch, the English
clergyman, and Arnprior, and upon the 26th of the

had above thirty communicants. He suffer'd at Penrith
upon Tuesday, October 28th, the festival of St. Simon
and St. Jude, 1746, and perform'd the whole devotions
upon the scaffold, with the same calmness and composure
of mind and the same decency of behaviour, as
if he had been only a witness of the fatal scene. He
delivered every word of his speech to the numerous
crowd of spectators. Mr. Lyon never saw the speeches
of Mr. Deacon and Mr. Syddal,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which some might

<h2>The <span class="smcap">Speech</span> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Theodore Deacon</span>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></h2>

<div class="sidenote">30 July
1746</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 37.] <span class="smcap">My dear fellow-countrymen</span>,&mdash;I am come here to pay the
last debt to nature, and I think myself happy in having an
opportunity of dying in so just and so glorious a cause. The
deluded and infatuated vulgar will no doubt brand my death
with all the infamy that ignorance and prejudice can suggest.
But the thinking few who have not quite forsaken their duty
to God and their king, will I am persuaded look upon it as
being little inferiour to martyrdom itself, for I am just going
to fall a sacrifice to the resentment and revenge of the Elector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of Hanover and all those unhappy miscreants who have openly
espoused the cause of a foreign German usurper and withdrawn
their allegiance from their only rightful, lawful and
native sovereign, King James the 3d. It would be trifling here
to expatiate on the loss of so many brave subjects' lives who
have had the courage to appear in defence of their native King;
[<em>fol.</em> 38.]
the vast, the immense treasure squandered away in defence of
the Usurper; the heavy load of taxes and debts under which the
nation groans; the prevalence of bribery and corruption; the
preference of strangers to natives, and innumerable other inconveniencies
which must necessarily attend a foreigner's sitting
on the throne of Great Britain, and which must be too obvious
to every impartial, unprejudiced Englishman.</p>

<p>Moreover, I think it is very evident that the very mercy of
the Usurper is no less than arbitrary power, and the freedom
of Parliament, bribery, and corruption; from which unhappy
circumstances nothing else can restore this nation and bring it
to its former happiness and glory but inviting King James the
3d to take possession of his undoubted right.</p>

<p>I profess I die a member, not of the Church of Rome, nor
yet that of England, but of a pure Episcopal Church which
[<em>fol.</em> 39.]
has reform'd all the errors, corruptions and defects that have
been introduc'd into the modern Churches of Christendom&mdash;a
church which is in perfect communion with the antient and
universal Church of Christ, by adhering uniformly to antiquity,
universality and consent, that glorious principle which if once
strictly and impartially pursued would, and which alone can,
remove all the distractions and unite all the divided branches
of the Christian Church. This truly Catholick principle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
agreed to by all the Churches, Eastern and Western, Popish
and Protestant, and yet is unhappily practised by none but
the Church in whose holy communion I have the happiness to
die. May God of his great mercy daily increase the members
thereof. And if any would enquire into its primitive constitution,
I refer them to our Common Prayer-Book, intitled 'A
compleat Collection of Devotions, both publick and private,
[<em>fol.</em> 40.]
taken from the Apostolick constitutions, antient Liturgies, and
the Common Prayer-Book of the Church of England, printed
at London. 1734.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I sincerely declare I forgive all my enemies, who have raised
on me any false or scandalous reports, the pretended Court by
which I was tried, and all those who were witnesses against
me, particularly the unfortunate, deluded Mr. Maddox,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who
has added the sin of unparallel'd ingratitude to those of
treachery to his fellow-subjects, perfidiousness to his lawful
prince and perjury against his God, having sworn away the
lives of those very persons who chiefly supported him while he
attended on the Prince's army, and for a month after he was
taken prisoner. And further, I affirm on the word of a dying
man he perjured himself in the evidence he gave against me at
my trial, as I verily believe he did in what he swore against
[<em>fol.</em> 41.]
most if not all of the others.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, I most freely forgive my two principal enemies, the
Elector of Hanover and his son, who claims the pretended
title of Duke of Cumberland, who are actually guilty of
murder in putting me with many others to death, after the
latter had granted a regular, formal capitulation in writing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
which is directly contrary to the laws of God and nations, and
I hope will be a sufficient warning to all those who shall hereafter
have spirit, honour and loyalty enough to take up arms
in defence of their lawful sovereign, King James the 3d, or
any of his successors against the Usurper and his descendants.
I say, I hope it will be a sufficient warning for them never to
surrender to Hanoverian mercy, but to die bravely with swords
in their hands. Not but I submit with the utmost chearfulness
and tranquility to this violent death, being thoroughly
[<em>fol.</em> 42.]
convinc'd that thereby I shall be of much more service to my
beloved country and fellow-subjects as well as my only lawful
king, my dear, brave Prince of Wales and the Duke of York
(whom God of his infinite mercy bless, preserve and restore!),
than all I could do by fighting in the field or any other way.</p>

<p>I publickly profess that I heartily repent of all my sins, but
am so far from reckoning the fact for which I am to die one
of them that I think I shall thereby be an honour to my
family, and if I had ten thousand lives would chearfully and
willingly lay them down in the same cause. And here I
solemnly affirm that malicious report to be false and groundless
which has been spread (merely with design to involve my
relations in inconveniencies), that I engaged in this affair thro'
their persuasion, instigation and even compulsion. On the
contrary, I was always determin'd to embrace the first opportunity
[<em>fol.</em> 43.]
of performing my duty to my Prince, which I did without
consulting or being advised to it by any friend on earth.</p>

<p>And now, my dear countrymen, I have nothing more to say
than to advise you to return to your duty before it be too
late and before the nation be entirely ruin'd. Compare the
paternal and tender affection which your King has always
shewn for this, his native country, with the rashness of the
Usurper, and his great regard to his German dominions, the
interest of which has been always preferr'd to that of England.
Compare the extraordinary clemency and humanity of the
ever glorious Prince Charles with the horrid barbarities and
cruelties of the Elector's son which he perpetrated in Scotland.
Remember what solemn promises have been given by both our
King and Prince Charles to protect you in your laws, religion
and liberties. Has not the Prince thrown himself into your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 44.]
arms? Has he not given sufficient proof of his abilities in the
Cabinet, as well as bravery in the field? In fine, he has done
his part, and consequently the sin must lye at your door if you
do not yours.</p>

<p>May God be pleased to bless this land and to open the eyes
of the people that they may discern their duty and true interest,
and assist in restoring their only natural King to his
indisputable and just right! God bless and prosper him, and
guide him in all his undertakings! So prayeth</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Speech of Mr. Thomas Syddal.</span><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">30 July
1746</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 45.] Friends, Brethren and Countrymen,&mdash;Since I am brought
here to be made a sacrifice for doing the duty of a Christian
and an Englishman, it may be expected I should give some
account of myself and the cause for which I suffer. This expectation
I will gladly indulge. And I wish the whole kingdom
might be inform'd of all that I now say at the hour of death
when there is the least reason to doubt my sincerity.</p>

<p>I die a member, not of the Church of Rome, nor yet of that
of England, but of a pure Episcopal Church, which hath
reformed all the errors, corruptions and defects that have
been introduced into the modern Churches of Christendom&mdash;a
church which is in perfect communion with the ancient and
universal Church of Christ by adhering uniformly to antiquity,
universality and consent, that glorious principle which if once
[<em>fol.</em> 46.]
strictly and impartially pursued would, and which alone can,
remove all the distractions and unite all the divided branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of Christendom. This truly Catholick principle is agreed to
by all Churches, Eastern and Western, Popish and Protestant,
and yet unhappily is practised by none but the Church in whose
holy communion I have the happiness to die. May God in
His great mercy daily increase the members thereof! And if
any would enquire into its primitive constitution I refer them
to our Common Prayer Book which is intitled 'A compleat
Collection of Devotions, both publick and private, taken from
the Apostolical Constitutions, the ancient Liturgies, and the
Common Prayer Book of the Church of England, printed at
London in the year 1734.'</p>

<p>I most humbly and heartily offer up my praises and thanksgiving
to Almighty God that He hath been pleased of His
great goodness to give me grace to follow the pious example of
my father,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who enduring hardships, like a good soldier of
[<em>fol.</em> 47.]
Jesus Christ, was martyred under the government of the late
Usurper in the year 1715, for his loyal zeal in the cause of his
lawful King.</p>

<p>And I solemnly declare that no mean, wicked motives of
revenging my father's death (as hath been uncharitably said)
induced me to join in attempting a restoration of the royal
family. I think I had no occasion to be displeased with his
murderers, when I reflect (as I firmly believe) that instead of
punishing they sent him to his everlasting rest sooner than he
would have gone according to the course of nature. And so
far from doing an injury to his family, they pointed him out
by his sufferings an excellent example of Christian courage,
and contributed by that means to the good of his innocent
children.</p>

<p>Neither was I tempted to enter into the army commanded
by the Prince of Wales by any ambitious or self-interested
[<em>fol.</em> 48.]
views. I was easy in my circumstances and wanted no addition
of riches to increase my happiness. My desires were limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
within reasonable bounds, and what I thought I had occasion
for (I bless God) I was able to procure. And to make my joy
as full as in this world ought to be wish'd, I was blessed with an
excellent, faithful, religious, loving wife, and five children, the
tender objects of our care and affection. In this situation I
was void of ambition and thankful to God for His gracious
disposal of me.</p>

<p>My motive for serving in the Prince's army was the duty I
owe to God, the King and the country, in endeavouring the
restoration of King James the Third and the royal family;
which I am persuaded is the only human means by which this
nation can ever become great and happy. For altho' I have
never had the honour of seeing his Majesty, yet I am well
[<em>fol.</em> 49.]
assur'd by others of his excellent wisdom, justice and humanity
and that he would think it his greatest glory to rule over a free
and happy people without the least innovation of their religion
or liberties.</p>

<p>For this we have not only the royal promise of the King
himself (than which a reasonable people cannot desire a greater
security) but we have also the word of a young Prince who is
too great and good to stoop to a falsity or to impose upon any
people&mdash;a Prince blessed with all the qualities which can adorn
a throne, and who may challenge his keenest enemies to impute
to him any vice which can blacken his character, whom to serve
is a duty and a pleasure, and to die for an honour.</p>

<p>And here I cannot but take notice that if his Royal Highness
had any of that cruelty in his temper which hath so abundantly
displayed itself in his enemy, the pretended Duke of Cumberland,
[<em>fol.</em> 50.]
he would have shewn it upon Mr. John Weir,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> when
he had him in his power, and knew that he had been a spy
upon the royal family abroad and upon the Prince at home,
almost from the time of his first landing. But the brave
unfortunate young heroe, with noble compassion, spared that
life which hath since been employed in our destruction. If
I might presume to say that the gallant good Prince hath any
fault it would be that of an ill-timed humanity. For if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
been so just to himself and the righteous cause wherein he was
engag'd as to have made examples of some of those who
betrayed him, in all human probability he had succeeded in his
glorious undertaking and been reserved for a fate to which his
unequall'd virtues justly entitle him.</p>

<p>There is one thing I am bound in justice to others to take
[<em>fol.</em> 51.]
notice of in respect to Mr. Samuel Maddox, who for prudential
reasons was not produced upon my trial to imbrue his hands
in my blood, as well as in that of my fellow-sufferers. Yet I
solemnly declare in the presence of Heaven (where I hope shortly
to be) that in the trial of Mr. Thomas Deacon and Mr. John
Berwick,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I heard him perjure himself, as I verily believe he did
in every trial upon which he was produced as an evidence.
To this sin of perjury he hath also added the odious crime of
ingratitude, for to my own knowledge he was under great
obligations to the very people against whom he has falsly
sworn, and was supported and kept from starving by them and
me for a considerable while in prison when nobody else would
assist him.</p>

<p>I heartily forgive all who had any hand in the scandalous
surrender of Carlisle; for as it was the opinion of every one of
[<em>fol.</em> 52.]
the garrison who had been in foreign service that the place was
tenable many days, and as the Elector's troops then lying
before the town were in a bad condition, it is highly probable
that a gallant defence (which I strenuously insisted upon)
would have procured us such terms as to have prevented the
fate to which we are now consign'd. I also forgive the
pretended Duke of Cumberland for his dishonourable and
unsoldierly proceeding in putting us to death in violation of
the laws of nations after a written capitulation to the contrary,
and after the garrison, upon the faith of that capitulation,
had surrendred the place and faithfully performed all the
conditions required of them.</p>

<p>I pray God to forgive and turn the hearts of the bishops and
their clergy who, prostituting the duty of their holy profession,
have departed from their function as messengers of peace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
scandalously employed themselves in their pulpits to abuse the
[<em>fol.</em> 53.]
best Prince engaged in the most righteous cause in the world,
and against their own consciences and opinions, represented him
and his army in a disadvantageous and false light, in order to
get the mob on their side and spirit up an unthinking people
to a blood-thirsty, cruel and unchristian disposition. I could
heartily wish these men would prefer suffering to sinning, and
consider how contrary it is to the character of a truly Christian
pastor to receive instructions about what doctrine to preach
from the baneful Court of an impious Usurper. The credulous,
deluded mob, who have been thus set on by their teachers, I
also pray God to forgive for the barbarous insults I received
from them when in chains. Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do!</p>

<p>As I have before given thanks to Almighty God for the
example of my honest father, so I beseech him that the same
[<em>fol.</em> 54.]
Christian, suffering spirit may ever be in all my dear children;
praying that they may have the grace to tread the same
dangerous steps which have led me to this place, and may also
have the courage and constancy to endure to the end and
despise human power when it stands oppos'd to duty.</p>

<p>I pray God of his great mercy and goodness that he would
be pleased to pour down the choicest of his blessings upon the
sacred head of his Majesty, King James the Third, and his
royal sons, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York; and
(although England be not in a disposition to deserve so great
a blessing, yet for the sake of justice and the love which Nature
and duty prompt me to bear my native country) to restore
them soon to their lawful, natural and undoubted rights, and
in the meanwhile to inspire them with Christian patience and
firmness of heart to bear their undeserved misfortunes.</p>

<p>It would be an unspeakable satisfaction to me if my manner
[<em>fol.</em> 55.]
of dying, or anything I now say, would contribute to the
removing those unhappy and unreasonable prejudices with
which too many of my countrymen are mislead. Danger of
Popery and fear of French power are the idle pretences that
wicked and ill-designing men make use of to misguide and stir
up the passions of unwary (though perhaps honest) people.
But if Englishmen would seriously consider that those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
make the most noise about Popery are remarkably void of any
religion at all, and dissolute in their morals; that Atheism,
infidelity, profaneness and debauchery are openly avowed and
practised even within the walls of that very Court whence they
derive all their fancied religious and civil liberties. If they
would reflect (when they talk of French influence) that they
seek protection from a German Usurper, who is hourly
aggrandizing himself and raising his foreign dominions upon
the ruines of the deluded people of England. If they would
reflect that I and my fellow-sufferers are now murdered in
[<em>fol.</em> 56.]
order to weaken the cause of loyal virtue, and to strike a terror
into the minds of all such as have the honest inclination to do
their King, their country and themselves justice. If they would
reflect upon the calamities, the massacres, the desolation of
Scotland, which presage the destruction of this already more
than half-ruined country, surely they would find but little
cause to be pleased with their situation&mdash;a situation so
extremely distant from honour and happiness that it would be
uncharitable and misbecoming a dying man to wish even his
most inveterate enemies to continue in it, and which I therefore
pray God, of his infinite mercy, to deliver all Englishmen
from.</p>

<p>If, my dear countrymen, you have any regard to your own
happiness, which, in charity, I have endeavoured to point out
in my dying moments, let me beseech you, in the name of God,
to restore your liege sovereign, and with him the glorious
[<em>fol.</em> 57.]
advantages of an excellent constitution under a lawful government.
This is every man's duty to aim at. And if your
honest attempts should fail, remember it is a great blessing to
die for the cause of virtue, and that an almighty power can and
will reward such as suffer for righteousness sake.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Speech</span> of the Right Honourable <span class="smcap">Arthur,
Lord Balmerino</span>.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">18 Aug. 1746.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 58.] I was bred in Anti-Revolution principles which I have ever
persevered in, from a sincere persuasion that the restoration of
the royal family and the good of my country are inseparable.</p>

<p>The action of my life which now stares me most in the face
is my having accepted a company of foot from the late Princess
Anne, who I know had no more right to the crown than her
predecessor, the Prince of Orange, whom I ever consider'd as an
usurper.</p>

<p>In the year 1715 as soon as the King landed in Scotland I
thought it my indispensible duty to join his standard, tho' his
affairs were then in a desperate condition.</p>

<p>I was in Switzerland in the year 1734, where I received a
letter from my father, acquainting me of his having procured
me a remission and desiring me to return home. Not thinking
[<em>fol.</em> 59.]
myself at liberty to comply with my father's desire without the
King's approbation, I wrote to Rome to know his Majesty's
pleasure, and was directed by him to return home; and at the
same time I received a letter of credit upon his banker at Paris,
who furnished me with money to defray the expense of my
journey and put me in proper repair.</p>

<p>I think myself bound upon this occasion to contradict a
report which has been industriously spread and which I never
heard of till I was a prisoner, 'That orders were given to the
Prince's army to give no quarters at the battle of Culloden.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
With my eye upon the block (which will soon bring me before
the highest of all tribunals) I do declare that it is without all
manner of foundation; both because it is impossible it could
have escap'd the knowledge of me, who was Captain of the
Prince's Life-guards, or of Lord Kilmarnock, who was Colonel
of his own regiment; but still much more so because it is
entirely inconsistent with the mild and generous nature of
[<em>fol.</em> 60.]
that brave Prince, whose patience, fortitude, intrepidity and
humanity, I must declare upon this solemn occasion, are
qualities in which he excells all men I ever knew, and which it
ever was his greatest desire to employ for the relief and preservation
of his father's subjects. I believe rather that this report
was spread to palliate and excuse the murders they themselves
committed in cold blood after the battle of Culloden.</p>

<p>I think it my duty to return my sincere acknowledgments
to Major White and Mr. Fowler for their human and complaisant
behaviour to me during my confinement. I wish I
could pay the same compliment to Governor Williamson who
used me with the greatest inhumanity and cruelty. But having
taken the sacrament this day I forgive him as I do all my
enemies.</p>

<p>I die in the religion of the Church of England which I look
[<em>fol.</em> 61.]
upon as the same with the Episcopal Church of Scotland in
which I was brought up.</p>

<p>When he laid his head upon the block, he said: God reward
my friends and forgive my enemies! Bless and restore the
King, the Prince, and the Duke, and receive my soul. Amen!</p>

<p>Lord Balmerino taking leave of his fellow-sufferer, Lord

in such an expedition, and that he wished he alone might
pay the whole reckoning. He was himself asked by one of the

<div class="sidenote">1746

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 62.]
As I am now to suffer a publick, cruel, barbarous and (in
the eyes of the world) an ignominious and shameful death, I
think myself obliged to acknowledge to the world that it was
principle and a thorough conviction of its being my duty to
God, my injured king and oppressed country, which engaged
me to take up arms under the standard and magnanimous
conduct of his royal highness, Charles, Prince of Wales, etc.
It was always my strongest inclination as to worldly concerns
to have our ancient and only rightful royal family restored,
and even (if God would) to lose my life chearfully in promoting
the same. I solemnly declare I had no by-views in drawing
my sword in that just and honourable cause, but the restoration
of my king and prince to the throne, the recovery of
[<em>fol.</em> 63.]
our liberties to this unhappy island which has been so long
loaded with usurpation, corruption, treachery and bribery;
being sensible that nothing but the king's restoration could
make our country flourish, all ranks and degrees of men happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and free both Church and State from the many evil consequences
of Revolution principles.</p>

<p>I must here let the world know that the whole evidences, to
the number of six or seven, brought against me at my trial by
the Elector's council were perjured. What they aim'd to
prove was only relative to the battle of Gladesmuir, and in
this they swore the greatest untruths, and did not declare one
word of truth. I earnestly pray for their repentance that God
may forgive them, as I sincerely do, not only them but all
other my enemies in general.</p>

<p>I own indeed I was engaged in said battle and saw a great
[<em>fol.</em> 64.]
slaughter on all hands where I was posted. But sure I am the
evidences that appeared against me did not see one step of my
behaviour that day.</p>

<p>I thank God ever since I drew my sword in that just and
honourable cause, I acted not only in obedience to the merciful
commands of my glorious prince but in compliance with my
own natural disposition, with charity and humanity to my
enemies, the Elector's troops, when prisoners and in my power,
without receding at the same time from that duty and faithfulness
I owed to my prince and the common cause.</p>

<p>My being taken prisoner at the battle of Falkirk<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> was more
owing to my own folly or rashness than the bravery or valour
of the enemy, whom I saw before I was taken entirely routed
[<em>fol.</em> 65.]
and chased off from the field of battle. I fell into their hands
by supposing them at a distance, and in the twilight, to be
Lord John Drummond's regiment and French picquets; but
too late, to my sad experience, found out my fatal mistake.
And here I refer to my enemies to declare my behaviour on
that occasion.</p>

<p>Now though I am presently to die a cruel death, yet when I
consider the justice of the cause for which I suffer, it puts a
stop to every murmuring reflection; and I thank Almighty
God I resign my life to Him, the giver, with chearfulness and
submission to his Divine and all-wise providence.</p>

<p>I here declare I die an unworthy member of the Roman
Catholick Church, in the communion of which I have lived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
however much her tenets be spoken against and misrepresented
[<em>fol.</em> 66.]
by many; and in that I now expect salvation through the
sufferings and merits and mediation of my only Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ. But I hereby declare upon the word of
a dying man that it was with no view to establish or force
that religion upon this nation that made me join my Prince's
standard, but purely owing to that duty and allegiance which
was due to our only rightful, lawful and natural sovereign,
had even he or his family been heathen, Mahometan, or
Quaker.</p>

<p>I am hopeful and am persuaded that my valorous prince, by
the blessing of God, will at last be successful, and when in his
power, will, under God, take care of my poor wife and family.
And as I have no worldly fortune to leave my dear son, I recommend
him to the blessing and protection of Almighty God,
as the best legacy I can give him, and earnestly require his
[<em>fol.</em> 67.]
obedience to my last and dying command, which is to draw
his sword in his King's, his Prince's and his country's service, as
often as occasion offers and his lawful sovereign requires. As
I have the honour to die a Major in our King's service, I am
hopeful, if my dear child deserves it, he will succeed me at least
in the same office, and serve his Prince with the same honour,
integrity and faithfulness I have all along endeavoured, to
which his royal highness is no stranger.</p>

<p>I conclude with my blessing to my dearest wife and all my
relations and friends, and humbly beg of my God to restore
the King, to grant success to the Prince's arms, to forgive my
enemies and receive my soul. Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!
Into thy hands I resign my spirit!</p>

Luke, the Evangelist, 1746.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Major MacDonell was the first that drew blood in
the cause. He with only twelve or thirteen Highlanders
under his command had the courage to attack
two companies of soldiers (being eighty or ninety in
number), whom he chas'd for seven or eight miles in
Lochabar, and at last forced them to lay down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
arms and surrender themselves prisoners of war; among
whom were Captain John Scott, son of Scotstarvet;
and Captain James Thomson, brother to Charlton.
Captain Scott had a very pretty gelding which Major
MacDonell made a present of to the prince. There
was not the least mark of a wound upon the Major or
any of his worthy few, tho' many firings had been
[<em>fol.</em> 69.]
exchanged in the chase and severals of the soldiers were
wounded.</p>

<p class="hanging">I had a particular account of this gallant and surprizing
action (oftener than once) from the Major's own mouth.
He was a brave, undaunted, honest man, of a good
countenance and of a strong, robust make. He was
much given to the pious acts of devotion, and was
remarkably a gentleman of excellent, good manners.
That submission and chearfulness of temper with which
he bore up under all his sufferings may easily be discovered
from the following copies of letters which are
faithfully transcrib'd from the Major's own hand-writ,

received, and it gives me no small pleasure to find you are in
so much good health, amidst the many distressing circumstances
of your present situation. The friends mentioned in your letter
make a return of their compliments, and best wishes to you
with as much affection and earnestness as friendship is capable
of. In a word, that worthy person, my lady, gives you her
blessing.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 72.]
Some charitable and well-disposed persons in Edinburgh are
employing their good offices in raising a contribution for what
is needful amongst the poor prisoners with you; and I hope
their laudable endeavours will meet with success. For certainly
human nature in distress, be the case what it will, is always a
just object of pity and compassion, except to those selfish and
barbarous persons who are proof against all the tender feelings
of sympathy.</p>

<p>Your friends in the Castle of Edinburgh are ever mindful
of you. Kellie<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is put into the room with your companions,

solitary room where Kellie formerly was, and is not allowed to
step over the threshold of the door; a situation not at all
agreeable to his taste, for he loves a social life.</p>

That honest soul,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Cowley, glad am I to hear of his welfare.
Pray remember me in the kindest manner to him and all my
acquaintances with you, particularly Mr. Robert Lyon, whose
passing thro' Edinburgh I am heartily sorry I knew nothing
about; for I should have used my utmost endeavours to have
seen him.</p>

was yesterday on my trial, and after long and most eloquent
pleadings, was brought in guilty. Really, there never came a
more eloquent discourse out of men's mouth, and more to the
purpose than what my good and worthy friend Mr. Lockheart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>

regarded. I have wrote to my dear wife, but did not let her
into the whole, and I have recommended to her in the strongest
manner to goe forthwith home, and to manage her affairs at
home in the best way possible. And I recommend to you both
as ever you can oblige me (whose former favours I can never
forget) that you back what I have wrote her, and that you prevail

with her to goe directly home. I never will forgive either
of you if you do not manage this point. For tho' she would
come here 'tis probable she would get no access. And even
tho' she would get no access, our parting would be more
shocking to me than death. My trust was still on the
Almighty's providence, and as that is still the case with me, I
hope for the best and prepare for the worst. In a word, I am
afraid there are few here will escape being brought in guilty.
Before this Court there were the most villainous proofs laid in
against me by four of Colonel Leef's men and a dragoon, of
facts that I never was guilty of, not the least circumstance of
what they charged me with. But may God stand with the
righteous, for I freely forgive them. You shall hear from me

<p class="hanging">Mr. Burnet of Monboddo, Advocate, talking to one of the

matter by a principle of conscience, being firmly persuaded
in their minds that they were endeavouring to
do right to one that was injur'd, and whom they look'd
upon as their only lawful sovereign, having no ill design
at all against the person, family or estate of King
George, but wishing him to return to his own place;
and therefore their rising in arms could not strictly be
look'd upon as proceeding from a spirit of rebellion.

<div class="sidenote">1746

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 81.] It having been always deem'd incumbent on every person in
my situation to say something of himself and the cause he
suffers for, I could not decline it, however disagreeable to my
persecutors, when I once held it my duty.</p>

<p>The cause I embarked in was that of my liege sovereign,
King James the Third, from an opinion I long since had of his
just right; an opinion, founded on the constitution, and strongly
recognised and established by an Act of Parliament, now in its
full vigour, which neither the people collectively nor representatively
have any power or authority to subvert or alter.
[See the Statute of Charles 2d.] Nor can that law be repealed
but by a free Parliament summoned to meet by a lawful king,
[<em>fol.</em> 82.]
not by a Convention commanded by a foreign prince and
usurper, and intimidated and directed by him at the head of a
foreign army.</p>

<p>To this Convention we owe the Revolution; to the Revolution
we owe the accession of the family of Hanover; and to this
accession all our present ills, and the melancholy and certain
prospect of the entire subversion of all that is dear and valuable
to Britons.</p>

<p>My opinion of the King's title to the imperial crown of these
realms, thus uncontrovertible, received additional strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
satisfaction from his character and qualifications, confirmed to
me by persons of the strictest honour and credit, and demonstrated
to me, that his establishment on the throne of his
ancestors would be an incident as productive of happiness to
the subject as of justice to the sovereign; since his Majesty's
confess'd superiour understanding is absolutely necessary to
extricate our country out of that most desperate state she has
[<em>fol.</em> 83.]
been declining to since the Revolution, and has precipitately
fallen into since the accession.</p>

<p>On this declension and ruine of our country have the
favourers and friends of both Revolution and accession built
vast and despicable fortunes, which possibly they may entail
(with the conditions of slavery annexed) on their betrayed and
abandoned issue; it being much more clear that slavery will
descend from generation to generation than such fortunes so
acquired.</p>

<p>Have we not seen parliaments in a long succession raise supplies
sufficient to surfeit avarice? Do we not see that avarice
heaping up millions for the nurture and support of foreign
dominions on the ruines of that country that grants them?
Nor can this move the least compassion or even common regard
[<em>fol.</em> 84.]
for her welfare and interest from that ungrateful avarice.
British Councils since the Usurper's accession have had foreign
interest their constant object, and the power and finances of
the imperial crown of Great Britain have been betrayed,
prostituted, and squandered for the convenience and support of
the meanest Electorate in Germany; and the Elector's conduct
has been more destructive and detrimental to our country than
all the finesse, treachery and force that the French or any other
adversary's council and power could have attempted or effected.
Land armies only can sustain and cover dominions on the
Continent. These are raised in the country protected, and
maintained by the country protecting. Here Great Britain
has all the burden and Hanover all the advantage: whereas
navies are the British bulwarks, which have by the Elector been
neglected, misapplied, or employed to her disadvantage, and
can alone guard and protect her dominions and commerce.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 85.] If the present convention had any regard to self-preservation
or that of their constituents they would this session have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
new laws for the further security of privilege. The panick,
diffused universally over the Electoral family, would have prepared
an easy assent to any law in the subject's favour. But
even here these representatives omitted this second opportunity
of securing and improving the happiness of their electors; and
instead thereof have given additional power to the Usurper to
suspend the bulwark of liberty, and invert the order and method
of trials for treason&mdash;precedents they will have occasion one day
to repent of, since they very probably may fall victims to them.</p>

<p>The false glosses and fears of Popery universally propagated
have deluded unthinking, vulgar minds, and diverted all attention
to reason; when it is clear to any just reflection that his
Majesty can have no happiness but what results from his
Britain, who he must know from melancholy experience will
[<em>fol.</em> 86.]
not be tempted to part with the doctrines and exercise of the
religion established in her. His Majesty must know that a
lawful king must adhere to the constitution in Church and
State, and show a most inviolable attachment to those laws
that were made for the security of both, whatever indulgences
and concessions are made by conventions to an usurper for the
breach of all. A lawful king is a nursing father who would
protect us, and demand no more supplies than the immediate
services required, and those from the riches of the country, the
excrescences of trade and commerce, without prejudice to either.
And such would be deem'd best that were just sufficient for the
purposes they were raised, and for which only they would be
employed. But an usurper is a stepfather that builds his own
hopes and views on the ruine and destruction of his usurped
dominions, and has joy from the fleecing and impoverishing of
those under his influence and power.</p>

<p>Even his Majesty's enemies allow him great understanding.
[<em>fol.</em> 87.]
Nor has any one of them imputed breach of honour to him.
His abilities and sense of our situation would move him to
interpose in favour of his subjects, and are equal (if human
abilities are so) to extricate us out of the various perplexities
and intricacies we have been brought into by negotiations for
thirty years, for the preservation of the balance of power, to
the disappointment of every Briton's hope and the ridicule of
all our enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>If you once think, my brethren, you must repent. If you
repent you must make the constitution just reparation; which
can only be done by calling in your lawful king, James the
Third, who has justice to attempt and wisdom to compleat a
thorough reformation in the constitution and to fix it in its
pristine happy state; and which, in spite of all chicane and
prejudice, without a restoration, will never be done.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 88.]
I am to declare my happiness in having such a wife and
daughter that forgive my involving them in my misfortunes,
and having an undeserved share in them. I heartily thank
them and wish them both temporal and eternal happiness, and
hope that those who are friends to my King will look upon
them as the relict and orphan of a fellow-subject that has
suffered in the royal cause.</p>

<p>I glory in the honour I have had of seeing his royal highness,
Charles, Prince Regent, and of being admitted into his
confidence. And I here declare it the greatest happiness I ever
knew and the highest satisfaction; and such as even my vainest
thoughts could never have suggested to me&mdash;an honour to
every rational creature that can judge of the many requisite
virtues of a prince centred in him truly, tho' so often falsly
assign'd to the worst. His character exceeds anything I could
have imagined or conceived. An attempt to describe him
[<em>fol.</em> 89.]
would seem gross flattery, and nothing but a plain and naked
narrative of his conduct to all persons and in all scenes he is
engaged in can properly shew him,&mdash;a prince betrayed by the
mercy he shewed his enemies, in judging of the dispositions of
mankind by the benignity of his own. His fortitude was
disarmed by it, and his ungrateful enemies think they have
reaped the benefit of it. But let them not rejoice at his
misfortunes, since his failure of success will, without the
immediate interposition of providence, be absolutely their
ruine. What a contrast is there between his royal highness the
Prince and the Duke of Cumberland! The first displays his
true courage in acts of humanity and mercy; the latter a cruelty
in burning, devastation and destruction of the British subjects,
their goods and possessions. I would ask, Who is the true
heroe?</p>

<p>The report of my having betrayed his royal highness or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
friends is scandalously false. My appeal to the counsel for the
[<em>fol.</em> 90.]
prosecution on my trial and my suffering death must refute it
to all honest men. And I hereby declare I had rather suffer
any death the law can inflict. I deem death infinitely preferable
to a life of infamy. But the death I suffer for my King gives
me vast consolation and honour that I am thought worthy of it.</p>

<p>To conclude, my brethren and fellow-subjects, I must make
profession of that religion I was baptized, have continued and
shall, through the Divine permission, die in, which is that of
the Church of England, and which I hope will stand against
the malice, devices and assaults of her enemies, as well those of
the Church of Rome as those equally dangerous, the followers
of Luther and Calvin, covered under and concealed in the
[<em>fol.</em> 91.]
specious bugbears of Papacy and arbitrary power. This my
faith I have fully set forth in a poem of two books, intitled,
The Christian Test, or, The Coalition of Faith and Reason, the
first of which I have already published, and the latter I have
bequeathed to the care of my unfortunate but very dutyful
daughter, Mrs. Mary Morgan, to be published by her, since it
has pleased God I shall not live to see it. To this poem I
refer, which I hope will obviate all cavil to the contrary.</p>

<p>I freely forgive all my enemies, from the Usurper to Weir
and Maddox, the infamous witnesses in support of his prosecutions
of me. And I must also and do from my heart forgive
my Lord Chief Justice<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> for his stupid and inveterate zeal in
painting my loyalty to my King with all the reproaches he had
genius enough to bestow on it, when he passed sentence on
seventeen at once, and which he did without precedent, because
it was without concern.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 92.] I beg all I have offended that they will forgive me for Jesus
Christ sake, my only Mediator and Advocate. To whom with
the Father and the Holy Spirit be all adoration, praise, glory,
dominion and power for ever. Amen!</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746
28 Nov.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 93.] It would be a breach of duty in me to omit the last
opportunity of doing justice to those who stood in need of it.
I think it incumbent upon me the rather because I am the only
Englishman in this part of the world who had the honour to
attend his royal highness in Scotland.</p>

<p>When I first joined the King's forces I was induced by a
principle of duty only, and I never saw any reason since to
convince me that I was in the least mistaken. But, on the
contrary, every day's experience has strengthened my opinion
that what I did was right and necessary. That duty I
discharged to the best of my power; and as I did not seek the
reward of my service in this world, I have no doubt of receiving
it in the next.</p>

<p>Under an opinion that I could do more good by marching
[<em>fol.</em> 94.]
with the army into Scotland than by remaining with the Manchester
regiment at Carlisle, I obtained leave to be in my Lord
Elcho's corps, for I was willing to be in action.</p>

<p>After the battle of Culloden I had the misfortune to fall
into the hands of the most ungenerous enemy that I believe
ever assum'd the name of a soldier, I mean the pretended
Duke of Cumberland, and those under his command, whose
inhumanity exceeded anything I could have imagined in a
country where the bare mention of a God is allowed of. I was
put into one of the Scotch kirks together with a great number
of wounded prisoners who were stript naked and then left to
die of their wounds without the least assistance; and tho' we
had a surgeon of our own, a prisoner in the same place, yet he
was not permitted to dress their wounds, but his instruments
[<em>fol.</em> 95.]
were taken from him on purpose to prevent it; and in consequence
of this many expired in the utmost agonies. Several
of the wounded were put on board the <em>Jean</em>, of Leith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
there died in lingering tortures. Our general allowance while
we were prisoners there was half a pound of meal a day, which
was sometimes increased to a pound, but never exceeded it;
and I myself was a eye-witness that great numbers were
starved to death. Their barbarity extended so far as not to
suffer the men who were put on board the <em>Jean</em> to lie down
even upon planks, but they were obliged to sit on large stones,
by which means their legs swell'd as big almost as their bodies.</p>

<p>These are some few of the cruelties exercised, which being
almost incredible in a Christian country, I am obliged to add
an asseveration to the truth of them; and I do assure you
[<em>fol.</em> 96.]
upon the word of a dying man, as I hope for mercy at the day
of judgment, I assert nothing but what I know to be true.</p>

<p>The injustice of these proceedings is aggravated by the ingratitude
of them, for the Elector of Hanover's people had
been often obliged by the prince, who ordered his prisoners
the same allowance of meal as his own troops, and always made
it his particular concern that all the wounded should be carefully
dressed and used with the utmost tenderness. His
extreme caution to avoid the effusion of blood, even with
regard to spies when his own safety made it almost necessary,
and his surprizing generosity to all his enemies without distinction
certainly demanded different treatment. And I
cannot think that an English army under English direction
could possibly behave with such unprovoked barbarity.</p>

<p>With regard to the report of his royal highness having
[<em>fol.</em> 97.]
ordered that no quarters should be given to the enemy I am
persuaded in my conscience it is a wicked malicious lie, raised
by the friends of usurpation in hopes of an excuse for the
cruelties committed in Scotland, which were many more and
greater than I have time to describe. For I firmly believe the
Prince would not consent to such orders even if it were to gain
the three kingdoms.</p>

<p>I would gladly enter into the particulars of his royal highness's
character if I was able; but his qualifications are above
description. All I can say is, he is every thing that I could
imagine, great and excellent, fully deserving what he was born
for&mdash;to rule over a free people.</p>

<p>I die a member of the Church of England, which I am satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would flourish more under the reign of a Stewart than it
[<em>fol.</em> 98.]
does now, or has done for many years. The friends of the
House of Hanover say they keep out Popery. But do they
not let in Infidelity, which is almost become (if I may so say)
the religion established?</p>

<p>I think it every man's business by all lawful means to live as
long as he can; and with this view I made a defence upon my
trial which I thought might possibly do me service. All that
the witnesses swore on my behalf was strictly true, for I would
much rather die than be the occasion of perjury. After sentence
my friends petitioned for my life, and if it had been
granted I should have been thankful for it. But as it otherwise
happens I patiently submit, and have confident hopes,
that upon the whole, it will be better for me for I suffer for
having done my duty.</p>

<p>As I expected, so it happen'd upon my trial, Mr. Maddox
perjured himself, and I am afraid he is so immersed in wickedness
[<em>fol.</em> 99.]
that it would be difficult for him to forbear it. Lieutenant
Moore swore he was acquainted with me at Manchester,
but I declare I was never in his company before we
met at Inverness. I should think it a great reflection upon
the honour of any government to encourage officers to lay by
their swords and become informers. I forgive both these and
all my enemies.</p>

<p>I am convinced that these nations are inevitably ruin'd
unless the royal family be restored, which I hope will soon
happen. For I love my country, and with my parting breath
I pray God to bless it. I also beseech Him to bless and preserve
my lawful sovereign, King James the 3d., the Prince of
Wales, and Duke of York, to prosper all my friends, and have
mercy on me!</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 Oct.</div>

<h3>The case of Mr. Francis Buchanan of Arnprior is so very
singular, and attended with such odd, unaccountable
circumstances that an exact narrative of it ought to be
preserved, which is as follows:</h3>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 100.] Arnprior was taken prisoner at his own house some time
before the battle of Culloden by Mr. James Dunbar, captain
of militia, and eldest son of Sir George Dunbar of Dunbar
House or Woodside, and committed to Stirling Castle. As
Mr. Buchanan had never been in arms, nor had made any
publick appearance whatsomever in the whole affair from first
to last, so the ground of his commitment was only <em>suspicion</em>.
The commanding officer looking upon this to be very thin, and
not imagining Arnprior to be in any hazard at all, allow'd him
the full liberty of the Castle, to walk up and down as he
[<em>fol.</em> 101.]
pleased, without keeping a strict eye over him. When several
prisoners were ordered from Stirling Castle to Carlisle, Arnprior
was appointed to be amongst the number. Captain
James Thomson, brother to Charlton, and Lieutenant Archibald
Campbell (commonly called Tobie) had the command of
the party that guarded the prisoners in their journey. These
officers knowing well the case of Mr. Buchanan, and having
witness'd the usage he had met with in Stirling Castle, treated
him in a quite different manner from the other prisoners. In
the forenoon, as if he had been only a fellow-traveller, they
would have desir'd him to ride forwards to bespeak dinner at
a proper place, and to have it ready for them against the time
they should come up. In the afternoon they also desir'd him
[<em>fol.</em> 102.]
to ride on to take up night quarters and to order supper for
them, and all this without any command attending him; so
that he had several opportunities every day of making his
escape had he dream'd that he ran any risque of his life in the
issue of a trial. Besides, the officers wou'd not have indulg'd
him such liberties had they imagin'd any danger in his case.
When the prisoners came to Carlisle, Arnprior, much to his
own surprize and that of the foresaid officers, was immediately
ordered into a dungeon and to have irons clapt upon him.
Finding himself in a situation he had entertain'd no apprehension
of, and dreading the worst from this harsh usage he
sent for Captain Thomson, who very readily came to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
after some conversation upon the unexpected change of treatment
desir'd to know what he could do for him. Mr.
[<em>fol.</em> 103.]
Buchanan beg'd he would wait upon the commanding officer
and let him know his whole case, and the usage he had met
with both in Stirling Castle and in the way to Carlisle, which
he did not doubt would have a good effect for making a
change to the better in his state of confinement. Captain
Thomson frankly undertook to do as he desir'd, and without
loss of time, honestly represented the whole affair to the commanding
officer, who said he was heartily sorry for the gentleman,
but that it was not in his power to do him any service,
because the Solicitor-General was come to Carlisle, and that
(now he was in the place) his province it was to determine in
these matters. Captain Thomson did not stop here, but like
one of generosity and compassion, went directly to the Solicitor-General
[<em>fol.</em> 104.]
and laid before him the case of Mr. Buchanan,
requesting him to consider it and to allow the gentleman a
more easy and comfortable confinement. The Solicitor-General
told him he knew there were more Buchanans than one among
the prisoners, and therefore he desired to know what Mr.
Buchanan he meant; and then asked if he knew his Christian
name, and whether or not he had a designation. Captain
Thomson answered that he did not know Mr. Buchanan's
Christian name, that though he was sure he had a designation
he had forgot it. Upon this the Solicitor-General pull'd a
list of names out of his pocket, and after looking it over asked
the Captain if Mr. Francis Buchanan of Arnprior was the person
whose case he had been representing. 'That same is the
gentleman,' replied the Captain. 'Then,' says the Solicitor-General,
[<em>fol.</em> 105.]
'pray, Sir, give yourself no more trouble about that
gentleman. I shall take care of him. I have particular orders
about him, for <small>HE MUST SUFFER</small>!' This unaccountable speech
from such a mouth about one neither convicted nor tried surpriz'd
the Captain not a little and made him walk off without
insisting any more, to tell Arnprior the result of what had
pass'd, in the softest manner he could.</p>

<p>This narrative was given by Lieutenant Archibald Campbell,
after the execution of Arnprior, to several persons in Edinburgh,
particularly to the Rev. Mr. Thomas Drummond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When Arnprior was brought to a trial not a single overt
act was prov'd against him. An unsubscrib'd letter was produced
in the Court which had been intercepted in going to the
Highland army, and several persons, particularly Commissary
[<em>fol.</em> 106.]
Finlayson in Stirling, gave their affidavits that it was the hand-writ
of Mr. Francis Buchanan of Arnprior. Upon this the
jury without any hesitation or scruple brought him in guilty.
After sentence of death was pronounced against him so little
did people imagine that he would suffer that he was prevail'd
upon to send off an express to London in order to give a true
and exact representation of his case, not doubting but that
this would be sufficient to obtain a reprieve from a verdict and
sentence pronounced upon such slight grounds, but all to no
purpose. To destruction was he destin'd by his enemies, and
accordingly suffer'd death at Carlisle in company with the
Revd. Mr. Thomas Coppoch, Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart,
Major Donald MacDonell, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Arnprior left no speech behind him, but took an opportunity
[<em>fol.</em> 107.]
of declaring that as he was persuaded in his conscience King
James the 8th had the sole undoubted right to sit on the
throne of these realms, so the only action that stared him most
in the face was that he had acted the prudent and over-cautious
part in not joining the Prince immediately upon his arrival,
and drawing his sword in so glorious a cause, and in not
exerting all his endeavours upon those with whom he had any
interest to rise in arms for their King and country.</p>


<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>, A.M.</p>

<p class="hanging">Arnprior lived at the house of Lenny, near Callender, in
Monteith, and Stewart of Glenbucky came from Balquhidder
with his men. Arnprior went to see them in
Strathyre. There happened some dispute between
them about the Majorship of the Perth regiment to
which Glenbucky belonged. Arnprior brought Glenbucky
home with him to Lenny that night. On the
morning of next day he was found dead in his bed with
a pistol in his hand.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Speech</span> of the Right Honourable <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lord Balmerino</span>, faithfully transcribed from
his lordships own handwrit.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">1746
18 Aug.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 108.] I was brought up in true loyal Anti-Revolution principles,
and I hope the world is convinced that they stick to me.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge I did a very inconsiderate thing, for
which I am heartily sorry, in accepting of a company of foot
from the Princess Anne, who I knew had no more right to the
crown than her predecessor the Prince of Orange, whom I
always look upon as a vile, unnatural usurper.</p>

<p>To make amends for what I had done I join'd the King when
he was in Scotland, and when all was over I made my escape
and liv'd abroad till the year 1734.</p>

<p>In the beginning of that year I got a letter from my father
which very much surprized me. It was to let me know that
he had got the promise of a remission for me. I did not know
what to do. I was then, I think, in the Canton of Bern and had
no body to advise with. But next morning I wrote a letter to
the King, who was then at Rome, to acquaint his Majesty that
this was done without my asking or knowledge, and that I
[<em>fol.</em> 109.]
would not accept of without his Majesty's consent. I had in
answer to mine a letter written with the King's own hand
allowing me to go home, and he told me his banker would give
me money for my travelling charges when I came to Paris,
which accordingly I got.</p>

<p>When his royal highness came to Edinburgh, as it was my
bounden and indispensible duty, I join'd him, though I might
easily have excused myself from taking arms on account of my
age. But I never could have had peace of conscience if I had
stayed at home when that brave Prince was exposing himself
to all manner of dangers and fatigue both night and day.</p>

<p>I am at a loss when I come to speak of the Prince; I am not
a fit hand to draw his character. I shall leave that to others.
But I must beg leave to tell you the incomparable sweetness
of his nature, his affability, his compassion, his justice, his
temperance, his patience, and his courage are virtues, seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
all to be found in one person. In short, he wants no qualifications
requisite to make a great man.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I say, wherever I had the command I never
suffered any disorders to be committed, as will appear by the
Duke of Bucleugh's servants at East Park, by the Earl of
[<em>fol.</em> 110.]
Findlater's minister, Mr. Lato, and my Lord's servants at
Cullen, by Mr. Rose, minister at Nairn, who was pleased to
favour me with a visit when I was an prisoner in Inverness, by
Mr. Stewart, principal servant to the Lord President at the
house of Culloden, and by several other people. All this gives
me great pleasure now that I am looking on the block on which
I am ready to lay down my head. And tho' it had not been
my own natural inclination to protect every body as far as lay
in my power it would have been my interest so to do. For his
royal highness abhorred all those who were capable of doing
injustice to any of the King, his father's subjects, whatever
opinion they were of.</p>

<p>I have heard since I came to this place that there has been a
most wicked report spread and mentioned in several of the Newspapers,
that his royal highness, the Prince, before the battle of
Culloden, had given out in orders that no quarters should be given
to the enemy. This is such an unchristian thing and so unlike
that gallant Prince that nobody that knows him will believe it.
It is very strange if there had been any such orders that neither
[<em>fol.</em> 111.]
the Earl of Kilmarnock, who was Colonel of the regiment of
Foot-guards, nor I, who was Colonel of the 2d troop of Life-guards,
should never have heard any thing of it, especially since
we were both at the head-quarters the morning before the
battle. I am convinced that it is a malicious report industriously
spread to excuse themselves for the murders they were
guilty of in calm blood after the battle.</p>

<p>Ever since my confinement in the Tower, when Major White
and Mr. Fowler did me the honour of a visit, their behaviour
was always so kind and obliging to me that I cannot find words
to express it. But I am sorry I cannot say the same thing of
General Williamson. He has treated me barbarously, but not
quite so ill as he did the Bishop of Rochester. I forgive him
and all my enemies. Had it not been for Mr. Gordon's advice
I should have prayed for him as David does, Psalm 109.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope you will have the charity to believe I die in peace
with all men, for yesterday I received the Holy Eucharist from
the hands of a clergyman of the Church of England, in whose
Communion I die as in union with the Episcopal Church of
Scotland.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with a short prayer.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 112.]
O Almighty God! I humbly beseech Thee to bless the King,
the prince, and Duke of Yorke, and all the dutiful branches of
the royal family! Endue them with thy Holy Spirit, enrich
them with thy heavenly grace, prosper them with all happiness
and bring them to thine everlasting kingdom! Finally I
recommend to thy fatherly goodness all my benefactors and all
the faithful adherents to the cause for which I am now about
to suffer. God reward them! Make them happy here and in
the world to come! This I beg for Christ's sake, in whose
words, etc. Our Father, etc.</p>

<h3><em>Copy of a Letter to a gentleman in Holland, vindicating the
character of Arthur, Lord Balmerino, in a certain important
point.</em></h3>


<div class="sidenote">1746
Sept.</div>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have not yet been able to answer the cries of
the officers for beating orders, and I can conceive no other
reason for our Ministry's refusing them than that of the
[<em>fol.</em> 115.]
Young Chevalier's being in Scotland, and that they thought
that his escape might have been saved through their means.
But now that he is safe arrived in France, I hope that we shall
meet with no more difficulties.</p>

<p>I had the honour to be of Lord Balmerino's acquaintance,
and it was my misfortune to be pitch'd upon to attend upon
him in the Tower at his last moments, and upon the scaffold,
where I was witness to a behaviour that even exceeded all that
we read of in the heroes of antiquity. His whole behaviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was so composed, so decent that it greatly surprized the
sheriffs, the clergymen, his friends and the spectators; and
at the same time not a soldier present but was moved by his
intrepidity.</p>

<p>My Lady Balmerino is now at my elbow, and she has desired
me to write to your Heer Pensioner that she is greatly offended
at a passage in your <cite>Amsterdam Gazette</cite> of Tuesday, September
6th, 1746, where, in giving an account of that Lord's unhappy
end, the author is so insolent as to insert so notorious a falsehood
that it can in no sort be justified. He has no authority
from my lord, from the sheriffs, from the clergymen, nor even
from our lying newspapers. The government here had a power
over his body, and he has suffered for his rebellion. But
neither they nor their agents abroad have any just power over
[<em>fol.</em> 116.]
his reputation. 'Tis barbarous to the greatest degree, and
lays us under a necessity, let the consequences be what they
will, to give you my lord's own words on that point, a point
which he had greatly at heart to clear up; and they are as
follows:</p>

<p>'I have heard since I came to this place that there has been
a most wicked report spread, and mentioned in several of the
newspapers that his royal highness, the Prince, before the
battle of Culloden, had given out in orders, that no quarters
should be given to the enemy. This is such an unchristian
thing, and so unlike that gallant Prince that nobody that
knows him will believe it. It is very strange if there had been
any such orders that neither the Earl of Kilmarnock, who was
Colonel of the regiment of foot-guards, nor I, who was Colonel
of the 2d troop of life-guards, should never have heard any
thing of it, especially since we were both at the head-quarters
the morning before the battle. I am convinced that it is a
malicious report industriously spread to excuse themselves for
the murders they were guilty of in calm blood after the
battle.'</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 116.] I shall take it as a very great favour if you are so kind as to
lay the above before the proper person, whose authority it is
to take cognizance of it that he may be obliged to retract in
the most solemn manner, a falshood, uttered to the prejudice
of the reputation of one of the greatest men that ever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
born, let his principles have been what they will. It is my
Lady Balmerino's desire. It is mine, as his friend, and as a
friend to truth and justice.</p>

<p>I dare not presume to write to so great a man as the first
person of so great a republick. Therefore I beg that you
will lay it before him, and you will very much oblige, Dear
Sir, your, etc.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Speech</span> of the Rev<sup>d</sup>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Coppach</span> of
Brazenose Colledge, Oxford, commonly (but

<div class="sidenote">1746
18 Oct.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 117.] Dear Countrymen,&mdash;I am now on the brink and confines
of eternity, being to suffer a scandalous, ignominious death for
my duty to God, my King and country, for taking up arms to
restore the royal and illustrious house of Stewart, and to
banish from a free, but inslaved people a foreigner, a tyrant,
and an usurper. For never was the British nation since the
Norman Conquest govern'd more arbitrarily, or enjoyed more
precariously. Never was a nation under the canopy of Heaven
more grossly abused, more scandalously imposed upon, or more
notoriously deceived. Liberty has been banished. Tyranny
and oppression, like a deluge, have overflowed the land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Places of the utmost importance have been taken from the
most deserving and given to the illiterate, unexperienced or
unqualified. Our fleets and armies, once the terror of Europe,
are now the scorn, contempt and derision of all nations. The
one, like Æsop's mountain, has brought forth a silly, ridiculous
mouse; the other has brought home eternal infamy, shame
and disgrace. Such a Ministry and such a Parliament was
[<em>fol.</em> 118.]
nation never curs'd with. The former for these thirty years
past has exhausted our treasures, drain'd our purses on foolish
idle treaties and negotiations to procure us allies and friends;
and no friend or ally have we in the world we can trust, rely
on or confide in. The latter, vassals, creatures equally
despicable, void of honour and conscience, compos'd of pensioners
and placemen, have sacrificed their country, their all,
to the boundless ambition and insatiable avarice of a beggarly
Hanoverian electorate. Estimates, supplies and subsidies
have been granted, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemine contradicente</i>, though never so
illegal, unreasonable and unjustifiable. Such heavy taxes and
such a monstrous load of national debt this kingdom never
groan'd under since Julius Cæsar's invasion; so that justice
may say, never was Parliament (some few members excepted,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara avis in terris, nigro simillima cygno</i>) more slavishly devoted
or more sottishly infatuated.</p>

<p>Here it will not be amiss to introduce that worthy honest
gentleman, the Elector's Earl of Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> When a motion
was made by some true patriots to bring him to give an account
of his stewardship of the nation's money, did not his
Elector solemnly declare that a hair of his head should not be
[<em>fol.</em> 119.]
hurt, conscious that he had acted by his direction in sending
sums to aggrandize his poor, native, scrubby country, Hanover,&mdash;sums
to engage the affections of the wavering Dutch, sums
to biass the votes at elections?</p>

<p>These are facts the truth of which is too obvious. What
soul inspired with the least grain of courage, the smallest spark
of honour, or that sympathizes with the sufferings of his fellow-creatures,
would tamely sit down or patiently acquiesce under
such monstrous and unheard of grievances? When religion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
loyalty, liberty and property call to arms! when a prince
adorned with all the gifts of nature, and grace of education,
endowed and enriched with every virtue, amiable and commendable
(<em>maugrè</em> all your vile reports, invidious reflections
and slanderous aspersions; <em>maugrè</em> all your pulpit harangues,
stuff'd with downright falsities, gross calumnies and palpable
absurdities), daily amidst the horrid din of war, risks and
exposes his precious life to conquer and subdue the Lernæan
Hydra, to deliver you from almost Egyptian tyranny, bondage,
and slavery:&mdash;a prince whose title to the crown is indisputable,
whose conduct and courage are inimitable and matchless, and
whose virtue, mercy, and goodness none can parallel or equal!
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil viget simile aut secundum!</i></p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 120.] Such is your legal <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure-divino</i>, hereditary and lineally
descended Prince, whose father you exiled and excluded, whose
grandfather you rebelled against and banished, and whose head,
conscious of your own demerits, you have set a price on! Seeing
the heir, Come, say you, let us fall upon him and kill him,
and the inheritance will be ours. Be not too secure. Your
iniquities are almost compleated. The fulness of time is almost
at hand, even at the door, when the Almighty I <small>AM</small>, with my
Prince under the shadow of his wings, will pour out the vials
of his wrath, fury and indignation on that cursed, perjured
and abandoned people, on this guilty, perverse, wicked and
adulterous generation. For the innocent blood of the righteous
cries Vengeance! Vengeance! O my native country! my
native soil! What pangs hast thou to endure! What throes
to labour with! What misery and desolation is thy lot and
portion!</p>

<p>Kind Heaven! Avert all these evils by a speedy and blessed
restoration, that Albion may no more be scourged by vultures,
storks and logs; may once more see happy days, once more
put on its ancient lustre, pristin splendor and glory; that God
and Cæsar may enjoy their own just and due right; that
[<em>fol.</em> 120<em>a</em>.]
tribute may be rendered to whom it is due, custom to whom
custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour, and that
the supreme powers may receive the sovereign allegiance,
obedience and subjection which are really and duly theirs by
the laws of God and nature in conjunction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It is for sentiments and tenets of this kind I am now made a
publick spectacle, that my head is publickly to be exposed and
my bowels burnt; which I gladly and willingly submit to
without the least reluctance. Nay, I should rejoice beyond
measure, if this simple head of mine could be fixed on all the
Cathedral and parish churches in Christendom to satisfie the
whole Christian world of the honesty of my intentions and the
integrity of my principles. And could it be engraven on my
tombstone:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Underneath are deposited the ashes of the only English
protestant Clergyman whose honour, courage, loyalty and
zeal are conspicuous in his Royal Master's cause. Dulce
et decorum est pro patria mori.</span></p>

<p>I should have been silent about my religion had it not been
to satisfie and open the eyes of severals who have been deceived
by false representations, which was, I believe, the reason I was
spit upon, struck, stoned, insulted and barbarously treated by
severals (some of whom are since dead), not only in Carlisle
[<em>fol.</em> 121.]
but Kendall and elsewhere, when I was led in a string by Mark
Ker's dragoons through all the dirt and nastiness, with my
arms pinion'd, from Carlisle to Lancaster Castle, by an express
order of the pretended Duke of Cumberland, notwithstanding
Baron Clarke's specious harangue to make the jury believe I
was not an object worthy of their notice.</p>

<p>I declare then upon the faith of a dying man that I die an
unworthy member of that particular church, the Church of
England, as she stood before the Revolution, which I firmly
believe to be truly primitive, Catholic and Apostolic, free from
superstition on the one hand, and Fanaticism and Enthusiasm
on the other. May she prosper and flourish! May she, like a
house on a rock, withstand all tempests, storms and inundations,
till time shall be no more!</p>

<p>And now, God bless my royal, true and undoubted sovereign,
King James, his royal highness Charles, Prince of Wales,
Henry, Duke of York and Albany! O Jehovah! bless, protect
and preserve them! for nothing but fraud and anarchy
and confusion; nothing but horrid bloodshed and barbarous
murder, villainy, perjury, ambition and cruelty, barbarity
within and corruption without, have reigned triumphant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 122.]
this island since their banishment. God bless all my enemies,
persecutors and slanderers, especially that corrupted judge,
Baron Clarke, who put a most malicious construction on every
thing said at my trial! God forgive Samuel Pendlebury of
Manchester, John Hill, Thomas Joy, an Irishman, John
Gardener and Thomas Dennison, both of Carlisle, who all
grossly perjur'd themselves at my trial! O Lord God! send
them timely repentance and remission of their sins! I freely
and voluntarily forgive them; and humbly ask pardon of all
I have injured in thought, word or deed. I close with the
dying words of my Saviour and Redeemer, and the protomartyr
deacon, St. Stephen, 'Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do! Lord, lay not this sin to their charge!
Lord Jesus, receive my soul! Amen!'</p>

<p class="center"><em>Blessed are they who suffer for truth and righteousness sake; for theirs is

<div class="sidenote">28 Nov.</div>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 123.] <span class="smcap">Friends, countrymen and fellow-subjects</span>,&mdash;I was born in
Scotland, and brought up in the Established Church (as they
call it) of that kingdom. But of late (thanks be to God!) I
saw my error and became a member of the Church of England.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>I engaged in this just cause, for which I am to suffer, out of
the true love and regard I had for my king and country. For
I thought it my indispensible duty to join my Prince when I
found him in this country endeavouring to restore his father,
my lawful sovereign, King James, to his undoubted right. I
had the honour to be made a Captain by his royal highness,
raised a company out of my own pocket, and served my Prince
to the utmost of my power, even beyond what could have been
expected of one so little accustomed to military acts as I was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>And for thus faithfully serving my king, and endeavouring
to restore him and your ancient liberties, I am to fall a sacrifice
to the Usurper and his bloodthirsty son, the pretended
[<em>fol.</em> 124.]
Duke of Cumberland. But thy will, O my God! be done!
And as Thou art pleased that I suffer for truth and righteousness
sake, I resign myself entirely to Thy will!</p>

<p>And now I am in a few moments to launch into eternity, I
do solemnly declare, as I must answer at the aweful tribunal of
Almighty God, that the order said to be given by his royal
highness for giving the Usurper's men no quarters the day of
Culloden battle is false, and contrived merely to excuse the
barbarities committed by the Duke and his men on all those
of our army who fell into their hands; for I myself saw the
orders of that day. No. It does not agree with the Prince's
former lenity at the battles of Gladesmuir and Falkirk.</p>

<p>I leave the impartial world to judge of this brave Prince's
character from his actions, which would require one of the
greatest hands to do justice to it.</p>

<p>O my countrymen! Consider the woeful situation you are
in. In short, all that ever your forefathers fought for is gone.
You have nothing you can depend upon, burthened with debt,
ruined with a standing army. Alas! you have no more than
the name of Liberty. Rouse you then while it is in your
[<em>fol.</em> 125.]
power, and take the first opportunity to restore your lawful
sovereign, King James, which is the only sure way to make
these nations happy. I leave my hearty prayers for concluding
the same, and I hope Almighty God will, in His good appointed
time, restore my lawful sovereign, King James. And in a
particular manner, I beseech Thee, O God! to bless his
royal highness, Charles, Prince of Wales, and the Duke of
York.</p>

<p>I shall conclude with forgiving all my persecutors, hoping
Almighty God will of His infinite mercy, forgive me all my
sins, through Jesus Christ, pardon the frailties of my youth,
and accept my imperfect repentance.</p>

<p>Into Thy hands I commit my spirit, O Lord, Thou God of
mercy and truth!</p>

<div class="sidenote">15 April</div>
<div class="sidenote">16 April</div>

<p>Upon April 14th (afternoon) the Prince marched from Inverness
on foot at the head of his guards to Culloden House,
where the clans and others met him, and stayed thereabouts
under arms. He himself did not go to bed. Upon the 15th
by daybreak he marched the men up to Culloden Muir about
a mile south-east of the house, and review'd them drawn up
in two lines of battle. About eleven o'clock he ordered them
to refresh themselves by sleep or otherwise just in the field,
during which time he walked about cajoling the different
chiefs, and proposed to all of them separately to march off the
men towards the evening and attack the enemy by daybreak;
but finding the bulk of them against the proposal (reckoning
it rather too desperate an attempt untill they were joined by [<em>fol.</em>
127.] Keppoch and his men with others that were soon expected),
he drop'd the project. About 4 afternoon Keppoch arrived with 200
men. Then it was said Lord George Murray proposed the night march,
and undertook to manage the attack, which was agreed to. And when
near dark, the men were marched off, the front of the second line
following the rear of the first. About 2 o'clock of the morning of
the 16th the Duke of Perth came galloping up from aside to the front
of the second line, and ordered the officers to wheel about and
march back to Culloden. They had not gone above one hundred yards
back when they met the Prince, who called out himself, 'Where<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the devil are the men a-going?' It was answered, 'We are ordered by
the Duke of Perth to return to Culloden House.' 'Where is the Duke
of Perth?' says the Prince. 'Call him here.' Instantly the Duke came
up, and the Prince, in an angry tone, asked what he meant by ordering
the men back. The Duke answered that Lord George with the first line
was gone back three-quarters of an hour agoe. 'Good God!' said the
Prince, 'what can be the matter? What does he mean? We were equal in
number, and would have blown them to the devil. Pray, Perth, can't
you call them back yet? Perhaps [<em>fol.</em> 128.] he is not gone far
yet.' Upon which the Duke begg'd to speak with his royal highness.
They went aside a very short space. The Prince returned and call'd
out, 'There is no help for it, my lads; march back to Culloden
House.' Back they marched to Culloden House (the Prince bringing up
the rear) where the bulk of them arrived about 6 in the morning. The
Prince after ordering and earnestly recommending to everybody to do
their utmost to get provisions to his men went into the house, threw
himself upon the top of a bed, boots, etc., upon him; but in a few
hours, being alarmed with the approach of the enemy he hurried to the
field, and endeavoured to put his men in order by drawing them up in
two lines. But they, being some fatigued and others dispersed about
seeking victuals, could not be all got together; so that when the
cannonading began there were not 3000 men in the field, and these not
in the best order. At that time the Prince was in the rear of all,
ordering some men to replace some others that he had sent from the
second line to the left of the first. He immediately [<em>fol.</em> 129.]
sent off an aid-de-camp with orders to the generals in the front to
make the attack, and, moving forwards beyond the second line, sent
off a second and a third aid-de-camp with positive orders to attack.
It seems the first aid-de-camp happened to be killed with a cannon
shot just at setting out, which 'tis thought was the reason the
attack was not made soon enough.</p>

<p>Upon the right the attack was made with great bravery by
the Athol brigade, Stewarts, Camerons, and part of the MacDonalds;
but the left was so soon flanked by a great body of
the enemy's horse that from the centre to the left they never
got up to give their fire. The right broke in upon the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sword in hand, and did great execution, but were likewise
soon flanked and very much galled by the grape-shot. And
Lochiel and Keppoch, being both soon wounded in the advancing,
were carried off, which their men observing, immediately
they fled; which so alarmed all the corps to the left
that they gave way in confusion.</p>

<p>Just at this time the Prince called out to stop and he would
light from his horse and return to the charge at their head.
[<em>fol.</em> 130.]
But a number of his officers got about him, and assured him
that it was improbable for them to do any good at present.
For since the clans had turned their backs they would not
rally, and it was but exposing his person without any probability
of success; and therefore intreated he would retire,
and really forced him out of the field.</p>

<p>The retreat was made with the utmost regularity. Not
above 500 of the Low-country men, having detached themselves
from the main body, kept together till they received the
Prince's orders to shift for themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;There was a battery of canon that played very
smartly for a considerable time just upon the place where
the Prince was, and one of his grooms was killed about two
hundred yards straight in his rear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the forces were entirely defeated he retired to a house
of a factor or steward of Lord Lovat, about ten miles from
Inverness, where meeting with that lord, he stayed supper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 April</div>

<p>After supper was over he set out for Fort Augustus (where
a musket-bullet was taken out of the counter of his horse),
and pursued his journey for Invergary where he proposed to
have dined. But finding no victuals he set a boy a fishing,
who caught two salmon on which he made a dinner, and continued
[<em>fol.</em> 131.]
waiting there for some of his troops, who had promised
to rendezvous at that place; and being disappointed he resolved
to proceed to Locharkaig. He arrived there on the 18th at
two in the morning and went to sleep, which he had not done
for five days and nights, his forces having been under arms,
marching and counter-marching without meat for 48 hours
before the battle. He remained there till 5 o'clock in the
afternoon in hopes of obtaining some intelligence; but gaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
none, he set out from thence on foot, and travell'd to the
Glens of Morar, over almost inaccessible mountains, where he
arrived on the 19th at 4 in the morning. He set out about
noon the same day for Arrisaig, through as bad ways as before,
where he arrived at 4 in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27 April</div>

<p>He remained there seven days waiting for Captain O'Neil,
who joined him on the 27th, and informed him, as did many
others from all quarters, that there were not any hopes of
drawing his troops together again in a body. Upon which he
resolved to go to Stornway in the Island of Lewis, a town at
the head of a loch of that name, in order to hire a ship to go
[<em>fol.</em> 132.]
to France. The person employed for this purpose was one
Donald MacLeod, who had an interest there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28 April</div>

<p>On the 28th he went on board in an eight-oar'd boat, in
company with O'Sullivan, O'Neil, and some others, ordering
the people to whom the boat belonged to make the best haste
they could to Stornway. The night proved very tempestuous,
and they all begg'd of him to go back, which he would not do.
But seeing the people timorous, he, to keep up their spirits,
sung them a Highland song. The weather proving worse and
worse, on the 29th, about 7 in the morning they were driven
ashore on a point of land called Rushness, in the north-east
part of the island of Benbecula, which lies betwixt the islands
of North and South Ost or Uist, being about 5 miles long
from east to west, and 3 miles broad from north to south,
where as soon as they had got on shore, the Prince helped to
make a fire to warm the crew, who were almost starved to
death with cold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30 April</div>

<p>On the 30th, at 6 in the evening, they set sail again from
Stornway, but meeting with another storm were obliged to
put into the island Selpa (Scalpa) in the Harris. This island
[<em>fol.</em> 133.]
is about one mile long and half a mile broad. There they all
went ashore to a farmer's house, passing for merchants that
were shipwrecked in their voyage to the Orkneys, the Prince
and O'Sullivan going by the name of Sinclair, the latter passing
for the father, the former for the son.</p>

<p>Thence they thought proper to send Donald MacLeod (who
had been with them all the time) to Stornway, with instructions
to freight a ship for the Orkneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">3 May</div>

<p>On the 3d of May they received a message from him that a
ship was ready. On the 4th they made the mainland and set
out on foot for that place, and arrived on the 5th about noon
at the point of Arynish, two miles southeast from Stornway,
having travelled 18 hours on the hills without any kind of
refreshment, and were misled by their guide, either thro'
ignorance or design. There a messenger from Stornway met
him, and told him that Donald MacLeod, having got drunk,
had told one of his acquaintances for whom he hired the ship;
upon which there were soon 200 people in arms at Stornway
upon a report that the Prince was landed with 500 men, and
was coming to burn the town; so that he and his company
were obliged to lie all night on the muir with no other refreshment
than bisket and brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6 May</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 134.] On the sixth they resolved to go in the eight-oar'd boat to
the Orkneys, but the crew refused to venture; so that they were
obliged to steer south along the coast side, where they met with
two English ships which compell'd them to put to a desart
island called Seafort or Iffurt, being about half a mile long and
near as much broad. There they remained till the 10th, and
must have famished, had they not providently found some salt
fish upon the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10 May</div>

<div class="sidenote">8 June</div>

<p>About ten o'clock in the morning that day they embarked
for the Harris, and at break of day on the 11th they were
chased by an English ship, but made their escape among the
rocks. About 4 in the afternoon they arrived at Benbecula,
where they stayed till the 14th, and then set out on foot for
the mountain of Corradell, in South Ost or Uist, being about
16 miles distant. There they stayed till about the 8th of
June, living upon fish and other kind of game, which the
Prince daily killed himself, and had no other kind of drink
than the water they found there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11 June</div>

<p>The Militia at this time coming to the island of Irsky
(Eriska), (which lies betwixt the island of Barra and South Ost
[<em>fol.</em> 135.]
or Uist, is about three miles long and one broad, and is the
very first British ground the Prince landed upon at his coming
on the late expedition); the militia, I say, coming to the
island, obliged the Prince and his company to disperse; and he,
with two or three others, sailed for the island Uia or Ouaya,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
lying betwixt South Uist and Benbecula. There he remained
three nights, till having intelligence that the militia were coming
towards Benbecula, he immediately got into the boat and
sailed for Loch Boysdale, but being met by some ships of war
he was obliged to return to Loch Karnon, which is about a
league and a half west southwest from the island Uia.</p>

<p>There he remained all day, and at night sailed for Loch
Boysdale, which is about 30 miles south of Loch Karnon, and
belongs to the MacDonalds. There he arrived safe, and stayed
8 days upon a rock, making a tent of the sail of the boat, and
lived upon fish and fowl of his own killing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 June</div>

<p>There he found himself in the most terrible situation, for
having intelligence on June 18th that Captain Caroline Scott
[<em>fol.</em> 136.]
had landed at Killbride within less than two miles of them, he
was obliged to dismiss the boat's crew, and taking only O'Neil
with him, he went to the mountains, where he remained all
night, and soon after was informed that General Campbell
was at Barnare (an island lying between North Uist and Harris),
being about two miles long and one broad. It belongs to the
MacLeods. So that now he had forces not far from him on
both sides, and was absolutely at a loss to know which way to
move, having forces on both the land sides of him, and the sea
on the other, without any vessel to venture into securely.</p>

<p>In this perplexity Captain O'Neil accidentally met with Miss
Funivella or Flora MacDonald, to whom he proposed assisting
the Prince to make his escape, which she at last consented to,
on condition the Prince would put on women's cloaths, which
he complied with. She then desired they would goe to the
mountain of Corradale and stay there till they heard from her,
which should be soon.</p>

<p>There they arrived, and accordingly remained two days in
great distress, and then hearing nothing from the young lady,
[<em>fol.</em> 137.]
the Prince concluded she would not keep her word. But about
5 o'clock in the evening a message came from her desiring to
meet her at Rushness, being afraid to pass the Ford, which was
the shortest passage, because of the militia. They luckily
found a boat which carried them to the other side Uia, where
they remained part of the day afraid of being seen of the
country people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<p>In the evening they set out in the same boat for Rushness,
and arrived there at 12 o'clock at night, but not finding the
young lady, and being alarmed by a boat full of militia they were
obliged to return back two miles, where the Prince remained
on a muir till O'Neil went to the young lady, and brought her
with him to the place appointed about sunset next evening.</p>

<p>About an hour after they had got to the Prince they got an
account of General Campbell's arrival at Benbecula, which
obliged them to move to another part of the island, where, as
the day broke, they discovered four vessels full of armed men
close on the shore. They having seen the fire on the land, made
directly up to the place where they were,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> so that there was
nothing left for them to do but to throw themselves among
[<em>fol.</em> 138.]
the heath, by which means they escaped being found.</p>

<p>When the wherries were gone they resolved to go to Clanranold's
house. But when they were within a mile of it they
heard that General Campbell was there, which obliged them to
retreat again to Rushness; from whence they set out in a little
yawl or boat for the isle of Sky about the end of June, and
were at sea all night. The next day as they were passing the
point of Watternish, in the west corner of Sky, the wind
being contrary, and the female frighted at turning back, they
thought to have landed there, but found it possess'd by a body
of forces; which obliged them immediately to put to sea again
after having received several shots from the land.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>From hence they went and landed at Killbride, in Troternish
in Sky, about twelve miles north from the above mentioned
point. There they also found a body of troops within
less than two miles of them, whose commanding officer rode as
far as Moystod or Mougestot, not far from Sir Alexander MacDonald's
seat, near which place they landed. He there
enquired of Miss Flora MacDonald who she was, and who was
with her, which she answered as she thought proper. [The
[<em>fol.</em> 139.]
officer, however, would not be satisfied untill he had searched
the boat. In the mean time the Prince was hid on shore, so
near as to hear what passed].<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>Immediately after this scene was over the Prince parted with
his female guide, and took to the hills, and travelled without
rest 15 long miles<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> south south-east in women's cloaths till he
came to Mr. MacDonald of Kingsburgh's house, where his
female guide met him again, having gone a nearer way.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> There
the Prince got his first refreshment, and stayed till next day,
towards the evening; when he set out from Kingsburgh's house,
but would not, on any account, let the consequence be what it
would, consent to put on women's cloaths again, having found
them so cumbersome the day before. He went 15 long miles<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
to a place called Portree or Purtry, where again he met his
female preserver, who had gone a different route, and which
was the last time they saw each other.</p>

<p>At Portree the Prince met Young MacLeod of Raaza or
Raasa, and with him went directly to the island of Raaza, being
[<em>fol.</em> 140.]
about ten (or 6) miles in a small yawl or boat, being the only
one to be got at that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 July</div>

<p>On the 1st of July he landed at a place called Glam, in
Raasa, where he remained two nights in a miserable hutt, so
low that he could neither sitt nor stand, but was obliged to lie
on the bare ground, having only a bundle of heath for his
pillow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3 July</div>

<p>On the 3d of July he proposed going to Troternish, in the
Isle of Sky, notwithstanding it blew very hard, and that he had
but the small yawl above mentioned, scarce capable of carrying
six people. However, he set forward about 7 o'clock in the
evening, having with him Mr. Malcolm MacLeod. He had not
gone far before the wind blew harder, and the crew, being
timorous, begg'd to turn back again. But he refused, and to
encourage them sung a merry Highland song. About eleven
the same night he landed at a place in the island of Sky called
Nicolson's Rock, near Scorobry (Scorobreck), in Troternish,
being about ten miles from Glam. He remained there all
night without any kind of refreshment, not even so much as a
[<em>fol.</em> 141.]
fire to dry his cloathes, being quite wet. In this wet condition
he was for the space of 48 hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 July</div>

<p>The next day about 7 o'clock in the evening he left this<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rock, being accompanied by Mr. Malcolm MacLeod, the latter passing
for the master, the former for the man, who always carried the
little baggage<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a
href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> whenever they saw
any person or came near any place. They marched all night through
the worst of roads in Europe, and did not halt till they arrived
at Ellagol or Ellighuil, near Kilvory or Kilmaree, in Strath, not
far from a place in some maps called Ord or Aird, in the Laird of
MacIntosh's<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a
href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> country, being full
24 miles long.</p>

<p>After two hours rest and some little refreshment the Prince
seem'd quite alert and as ready for fatigue as ever, and diverted
himself with a young child in the house, carrying him in his
arms and singing to him, and said that perhaps that child may
be a captain in my service [or] might live to be of great use to
him hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 July</div>

<p>At that place the old Laird of MacKinnon came to him,
and they set out together that day, being July 5th, for the
[<em>fol.</em> 142.]
mainland in a small boat, tho' the night was very tempestuous
and the coast very bad. The next day, July 6th, they landed
safe in Knoidart, which is 30 miles from the place they set out
from. At that place he left the Laird of Mackinnon, who was
the next day taken prisoner. In their passage they met with a
boat in which were some militia, with whom they spoke. As
they did not much exceed their own number, they were resolved
to make all the head they could, and to fight them in case
they had been attack'd.</p>

<p>What method the Prince took to conceal himself on the
mainland of Scotland, or what route he took till the 20th of
September, being the time he embarked for France, will be
made publick at another time.</p>

<em>Citadel of Leith, Saturday, July 11th, 1747.</em>
</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747 11 July</div>


<p class="hanging">Mr. Alexander MacDonald of Kingsburgh and his lady were
paying their compliments to my Lady Bruce, when it
was proposed to read the above Account or Journal in
the hearing of Kingsburgh, that so he might give his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[75]</a></span>
observations, or rather corrections upon it. He and
the whole company (about 14 in number) declared their
satisfaction in the proposal. There were present, John
Fullarton, senior of Dudwick; James MacDonald, joiner
in Leith; Lady Lude, with her eldest son and her
daughter; Mrs. Graham and her son; Mrs. Rattray,
Mrs. Jean and Rachel Houstons, etc.</p>

<p class="hanging">The Account was accordingly read, and Kingsburgh made
[<em>fol.</em> 143.]
the following observations:</p>

<p>Page<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> 130, near the foot. Instead of Invergar, it should be
Invergarry; a place belonging to the Laird of Glengarry.</p>

<p>Page 132, near the foot. Instead of Selpa, it should be
Scalpa, commonly called the Island Glass.</p>

<p>Page 134, at the foot. Instead of Irsky, it should be Eriska.</p>

<p>Page 139, at the top. Kingsburgh said it was not fact that
the boat was searched, and that the Prince should have heard
what passed.</p>

<p><em>Ibid.</em> Instead of 15 long miles south south-east, it should be
7 long miles.</p>

<p><em>Ibid.</em> Kingsburgh was at pains to represent to the Prince
the inconveniency and danger of his being in a female dress,
particularly from his airs being all so man-like, and told him
that he was very bad at acting the part of a dissembler. He
advised him therefore to take from him a suite of Highland
cloaths with a broadsword in his hand, which would become him
much better. But in the meantime that he should go out of his
house in the female dress, lest the servants should be making
their observations, and stop at the edge of a wood upon the
side of a hill, not far from the house, where he and others
should come to him with the Highland cloathes, broadsword,
etc.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDonald said that she behoved to employ her
daughter as handmaid to the Prince for putting on his womens
[<em>fol.</em> 144.]
cloaths, 'For,' said she, 'the deel a preen he could put in.'
When Miss MacDonald (<em>alias</em> Mrs. MacAllastar<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>) was a dressing
of him, he was like to fall over with laughing. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
peeness, gown, hood, mantle, etc., were put on, he said, 'O,
Miss, you have forgot my apron. Where is my apron? Pray
get me my apron here, for that is a principal part of my
dress.'</p>

<p>Kingsburgh and his lady both declared that the Prince
behaved not like one that was in danger, but as chearfully and
merrily as if he had been putting on women's cloathes merely
for a piece of diversion.</p>

<p>Agreeable to Kingsburgh's advice they met at the edge of
the wood, where the Prince laid aside his female rags, which
were deposited in the heart of a bush till a proper opportunity
should offer of taking them up; for these that were present
resolved to preserve them all as valuable tokens of distress.
After the Prince had got himself equipt in the Highland
cloathes with the claymore in his hand, the mournful parting
with Kingsburgh ensued. Away he went to struggle through
a series of fresh dangers, the faithful MacKechan still attending
him.</p>

<p><em>Ibid.</em> Instead of 15 long miles to Portree or Purtry, it
should be 7 long miles.</p>

<p>Page 140, line 1. Instead of 10 miles, it should be 6.</p>

<p><em>Ibid</em>, near the foot. Instead of Scorobry, it should be Scorobreck.</p>

<p>Page 141. Kingsburgh said that MacIntosh's country there
named behoved to be an error in the writer, for that MacIntosh
had no property in Sky, and it ought to be named
MacKinnon's country.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 145.] Page 142. Kingsburgh said that he thought the Prince with
old MacKinnon had landed in Moror and not in Knoidart;
but he own'd MacKinnon behov'd to know best. He said he
was pretty sure that old MacKinnon was made prisoner in
Moror, which might happen after his coming from Knoidart.</p>

<p>When all the Journal was read over, Kingsburgh observed
that the persons from whose mouths it had been taken had
not medled with his part of the story; 'and,' said he, 'they
were indeed right, for they know very little about it.'</p>

<p>Then particular questions were put to him with respect to
that pamphlet called '<span class="smcap">Alexis</span>, Part 1st.' To give some instances,
it was asked him, Whether or not it was true that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
took along with him out of Sir Alexander MacDonald's house
a bottle of wine and some bread in his pocket for the refreshment
of the Prince; that he had great difficulty to find him,
and that it was owing to the accidental running of a flock of
sheep that at last he found him sitting upon a rock? He
answered, 'All these things are exactly true as related in that
small pamphlet.' Then it was asked, Whether or not the
Prince made briskly up to him with a thick short cudgel in
his hand, and asked, If he was Mr. MacDonald of Kingsburgh?
He said, 'It was really so, and that the Prince very
pleasantly said, Then all is well; come, let us be jogging on;'
but that he told him he had brought some refreshment along
with him, which he behoved to take before they set out;
[<em>fol.</em> 146.]
which accordingly was done, they sitting upon the top of the
rock.</p>

<p>Asked further. If it was true that the Prince lifted the
petticoats too high in wading the rivulet when going to
Kingsburgh, and that honest MacKechan<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> hastily called to
him to beware? He said, 'It is fact; and that MacKechan
cried, "For God's sake, Sir, take care what you are doing, for
you will certainly discover yourself;" and that the Prince
laughed heartily, and thanked him kindly for his great concern.'</p>

<p>Asked further. If the cursing and blasphemous speech of
the Duke of Cumberland was such as represented in '<span class="smcap">Alexis</span>,
Part 1st.' 'Exactly so,' said he, for I had it almost in the
very same words from the mouth of Sir Alexander MacDonald,
who was witness to the Duke's expressing himself in that
rough way. 'Whom,' added he, 'I indeed never saw in the
face.' Then he said that '<span class="smcap">Alexis</span>' was exactly and literally true
in every ace (not only as to facts but even circumstances) that
concerned his management of and conversation with the Prince,
the <em>brogs</em> not excepted, and that he looked upon the recovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of C&oelig;lestius<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> as a great blunder, for that he had reason to
think that he fell (as design'd) in the attempt. 'This is not to
say,' added he, 'that I know anything certain of that affair, as
if I had been an eye-witness or conversed with those that had
seen the fact. But when I was prisoner in Fort Augustus, an
officer came to me and very seriously asked if I would know
[<em>fol.</em> 147.]
the head of the young Pretender if I saw it. I told him I
would know the head very well, provided it were upon the
body. But the officer said, What, if the head be not upon the
body? Do you think you could know it in that case? To
which I replied, In that case, Sir, I will not pretend to know
anything about it.' Kingsburgh told the company that he
was resolved if any head should have been brought before him
that he would not have made them a whit the wiser, even though
he should have known it. But he owned no head was brought
to him. He left it to the company to draw what inferences
they pleased from this conversation betwixt him and the officer.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Kingsburgh informed us that when at Fort Augustus, he
happened to be released one evening in mistake for another
man of the same name. When the irons were taken off him
he went to Sir Alexander MacDonald's lodgings to ask his
commands for Sky. Sir Alexander happened to be abroad,
but when he came in he was quite amazed when he saw Kingsburgh,
and said, 'Sanders, what has brought you here?'
'Why, Sir,' said he, 'I am released.' 'Released,' says Sir
Alexander, 'how has this come about? I have heard nothing
of the matter. I do not understand it.' 'As little do I know,'
says Kingsburgh, 'how it has come about. But so it is that I
have got free.' Then Sir Alexander ordered a bed to be made
[<em>fol.</em> 148.]
up for Kingsburgh in the same room with himself, and when
Kingsburgh (about 11 o'clock) was beginning to undress in
order to go to bed an officer came to the door of the room,
and asked if MacDonald of Kingsburgh was there. 'Yes, Sir,'
said Kingsburgh, 'I am here. What want you with me?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
'Why,' replied the officer, 'you must goe with me to Lord
Albemarle, who wants to speak with you.' 'Then,' said
Kingsburgh, 'I began to think within myself all was wrong
with me. I begged that I might be allowed to take my rest
all night in the place where I then was, and that in the morning
I should wait upon Lord Albemarle as soon as he pleased;
and that I would give my word of honour to do as I promised;
and besides, that Sir Alexander would engage for me.' 'No,
no,' said the officer, 'that will not do, Sir. These are not my
orders. You must come along with me quickly.' When
Kingsburgh came to the door and saw ten or 12 sogers with
screwed bayonets waiting to receive him, he did not like that
piece of ceremony at all. They had not gone many paces from
Sir Alexander's lodgings till they met Lord Albemarle running
himself out of breath, foaming at the mouth, and crying out,
'Have ye got the villain? Have ye got the villain?' Kingsburgh
mildly answered, 'O why all this hurry? Where is the
man that will refuse freedom when it is offered him? I am
here, my Lord, at your service. I had no intention of being in
a haste to leave the place, and though I had left it you would
have easily found me again, for I would have gone to my own
[<em>fol.</em> 149.]
house. I had no fear about any thing.' 'However,' says Albemarle,
still in a passion, 'it is well, Sir, you are not gone; I
had rather by G&mdash;&mdash; have given anything before this mistake
had happened.' 'Go,' added he, 'and throw the dog into
irons.' Instantly the orders were obeyed. But to do Albemarle
justice, Kingsburgh said that in a day or two he ordered him
into a better place and the irons to be taken away from him;
and every day after this that his lordship sent to him at dinner
time, three dish of meat from his own table, with two bottles
of wine. By this time the Duke of Cumberland had left Fort
Augustus in great haste to London.</p>

<p>It was represented to Kingsburgh that his lady during his
confinement had been telling some folks that upon conversing
with him (her husband) about the pamphlet '<span class="smcap">Alexis</span>,' he should
have said that he knew no body who could be the author of it
but Neil MacKechan, so pointed and exact it was in giving the
narrative. Kingsburgh, looking to his lady, said, 'Goodwife,
you may remember, I said that I knew nobody who could be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
author of that pamphlet but either Neil MacKechan or myself.'
When it was suggested that Neil MacKechan (a low
man) could not be thought capable of drawing up any thing
of that sort, Kingsburgh and his lady informed the company
that MacKechan had been educated in the Scots College in
Paris with the view of commencing clergyman, but that after
[<em>fol.</em> 150.]
getting his education he had dropt the design; that therefore he
was capable enough, and that he had proved a great comfort
to the Prince in his wanderings by talking to him in the
French language about matters of importance in their difficulties,
when perhaps it was not so prudent or convenient that
those who were present should know what they were conversing
about. They told likewise that they had never been so
much afraid of any person's conduct as that of MacKechan,
because he was a good-natured man and very timorous in his
temper. But they frankly owned they had done him great
injustice by entertaining any suspicion about him; for that he
had behaved to admiration, and had got abroad with the
Prince, the great wish of his soul; for he could never think of
parting with him at any time but upon condition of meeting
again, which MacKechan was so lucky as frequently to accomplish
even when at parting they could scarce condescend upon
a time or place when and where to meet.</p>

<p>Kingsburgh said that he asked particularly at the Prince
about Lord George Murray, whether or not he could lay
treachery or any such thing to his charge. The Prince
answered that he never would allow anything of treachery
or villainy to be laid to the charge of Lord George Murray.
But he could not help owning that he had much to bear of
him from his temper.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 151.] The Prince asked Kingsburgh if he could inform him anything
about the heads of the clans, what they were doing in
the present confusion. Kingsburgh answered that MacDonald
of Glencoe had surrendred himself, and that Cameron of Dungallan
had done the same. The Prince made no remark at all
upon Glencoe; but as to the other, said: 'Cameron of Dungallan!
Is not that Lochiel's major?' 'Yes,' said Kingsburgh,
'he is the same.' 'Why,' replied the Prince, 'I always looked
upon Dungallan to be a man of sense.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Prince was going out of Kingsburgh's house he
turned about and said, 'Can none of you give me a snuff?'
Upon which Mrs. MacDonald made up to him and offered
him a snuff out of a little silver-mill with two hands clasped
together upon the lid of it, and the common motto, Rob Gib.
Kingsburgh begged the Prince to put the mill into his pocket,
and, said Kingsburgh, 'He accordingly put it into a woman's
muckle poutch he had hanging by his side.' After the Prince
had met with Malcolm MacLeod, Kingsburgh said he had heard
that the Prince spying the carving and the motto asked MacLeod
what it meant. 'Why,' said MacLeod, 'that is the
[<em>fol.</em> 152.]
emblem we use in Scotland to represent a firm and strong
friendship, and the common saying is Rob Gib's contract, stark
love and kindness.' 'Well, MacLeod,' says the Prince, 'for that
very same cause shall I endeavour to keep the mill all my life.'</p>

<p>'All the female rags and bucklings,' said Kingsburgh and
his lady, 'that were left in the heart of the bush, were taken
up and carried to our house in order to be carefully preserved.
But when we had got notice that the troops had such exact
intelligence about the Prince that they particularized the
several bucklings of women's cloathes he had upon him, even
to the nicety of specifying colours, etc., (and Kingsburgh and
Miss MacDonald being by this time made prisoners) word was
sent to Mrs. MacDonald and her daughter to throw all the
female dress into the flames to prevent any discovery in case
of a search.' When the rags were a destroying the daughter
insisted upon preserving the gown (which was stamped linen
with a purple sprig), saying that 'They might easily keep it
safe, and give out that it belonged to one of the family.' The
gown was accordingly preserved, and Kingsburgh and his lady
promised to send a swatch of it to Mr. Stewart Carmichael at
Bonnyhaugh as a pattern to stamp other gowns from.</p>

<p>Kingsburgh rose from his seat, and coming about to one of
[<em>fol.</em> 153.]
the company whispered in his ear, 'Sir, since you seem to
know a good deal of these affairs, pray will you inform me
what you know of Barrisdales case?'<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> What do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of that point?' It was answered, 'It is certain enough that
Barrisdale entred into terms with the Duke of Cumberland,
that he received a protection for a certain limited time, and
that he touched money; but whether or not he was sincere in
the design of seizing the Prince, or if he intended to make use
of these stratagems for consulting the safety and preservation
of the Prince, was what that person could not pretend to determine.
But one thing was constantly affirmed by all the accounts
from abroad that Barrisdale was still in some sort of
confinement in France, <em>i.e.</em> a prisoner at large.' Kingsburgh
shook his head and said, 'I am sorry to hear that he is a
prisoner in any shape, for that says ill for him.' When Kingsburgh
was seated again this subject happened to be spoken of
publickly in the company, and all agreed that they had heard
that Barrisdale still continued to be in some sort of confinement
in France. Kingsburgh insisted upon its being a very
bad sign, and again declared his concern to have such an
account of him.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 154.] When some of the company happened to be talking of
Major Lockheart's cruelties in the Highlands, particularly
that of his having thrust his sword through the body of a
child aged four years, in at the belly and out at the back,
Kingsburgh's lady said, 'That was no rarity among them, for
that several old men, women, and children had been butchered
by them in the Highlands.'</p>

<p>Dudwick was exceedingly much delighted with the interview,
and said he had never before entertained any notion of
that little thing '<span class="smcap">Alexis</span>'; but that now it should be <em>a</em> favourite
of his, as he well knew the veracity of it, and what to say in
its behalf.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<div class="sidenote">14 July</div>

<p class="hanging"><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;After a confinement of twelve long months for one
night's hospitality, Kingsburgh was at last set at liberty upon
Saturday, July 4th, 1747, upon his preferring a petition to the
Justiciary Lords, wherein he pled the benefit of the Indemnity.
Before transcribing the above conversation into this book I went to
Edinburgh upon Tuesday's morning, July 14th, 1747, and read my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima

been exact enough. He told me it was very right, and exactly written
according to the terms of the conversation. That day Kingsburgh and
his lady had left Edinburgh, so that I could not have the opportunity
of reading it over in their hearing.</p>

Preacher and Chaplain at Fort-William.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">1746
1 Feb.</div>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 155.] The retreat from Stirling was made with the utmost hurry
and confusion. The evening before, Mr. O'Sullivan wrote
from Bannockburn to Lord John Drummond ordering him
to leave Stirling and cross the Forth by break of day, which
order his lordship obeyed, and by 5 in the morning marched.
This surprized the Highlanders, to whose officers it appears
these orders were not communicate, and made them believe the
enemy was near them, which occasioned such an universal consternation
that they went from Stirling as every one was ready,
and left most of their baggage, all the cloaths they brought
from Glasgow, and some of their arms.</p>

<p>Lochiel, who had been wounded at Falkirk, not being able
to ride or walk, went in a chaise with Mrs. Murray, and was
driving through St. Ninian's when the church blew up. Some
of the stones came very near them. The horses startled and
threw Mrs. Murray on the street, where she lay speechless till
she was taken up by some of the men. Had there been any
intention to blow up the church, doubtless Lochiel, one of
their principal officers, and the Secretary's lady had been
apprized of it and put on their guard to avoid danger.</p>

<p>When the Prince join'd the body of the army a Council of
War was held, in which it was debated whether the army should
march in a body to Inverness by Aberdeen or take the Highland
road, by which the chiefs could, with the greater ease, get
such of their men to rejoin them as had gone home with
[<em>fol.</em> 156.]
plunder after the battle of Falkirk, which would considerably
increase their army. The low-country men were of the former
opinion, the Highlanders of the latter. It was put to the vote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and the latter carried it by a great majority. However, the
Prince was positive for the Aberdeen road, with which Lochiel
complied. But Cluny, going out, met Mr. Murray, and told
him it was surprizing the Prince should be so positive in a
thing contrary to reason and his own interest, especially when
a great majority of the Council of War were of another opinion.
His expressing himself with a little warmth made Mr. Murray
speak to Sir Thomas Sheridan, who went to the Prince and
prevailed upon him to agree with what had been the opinion
of the Council of War. He marched with the Highlanders the
Highland road by Ruthven in Badenoch, to Inverness, where
it was resolved to attack Fort Augustus and Fort William.
Of either I can give no distinct account, but that the first was
taken and the siege of the other deserted.</p>

<p>Earl Cromertie and others were sent to different countries to
cover the rising of some and to prevent that of others. This
weakened the army, and tho' many joined the day before the
battle of Culloden, a great number did not. Earl of Cromertie,
tho' many expresses were sent to order his returning to Inverness,
in place of doing as commanded, was surprized and taken
prisoner, and these that did join were much fatigued. None
had got pay after they left Tay bridge in their march north,
and they were straitned in provisions for some days before the
battle. Cumberland's army was not opposed in passing the
Spey, tho' a considerable force had been sent there<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> for that
end. The Prince was in danger of being taken at MacIntosh's
[<em>fol.</em> 157.]
house, and his safety was chiefly owing to a mistake of Earl of
Loudon's men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">14 April</div>

<p>On Monday, April 14th, Lochiel in his return from Fort
William (from whence he had been called on Cumberland's
crossing the Spey) marched through Inverness. His men were
mustered at the Bridge-end, and being but two hours in town
when informed that Cumberland's army was at Nairn, 12 miles
from Inverness, he immediately marched to Culloden, tho' his
men and he were much fatigued, having marched from Fort
William in little more than two days, being 50 long miles.
He arrived in the evening, and then his regiment, with a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of Glengarie's, were ordered to mount guard upon the Prince.
They got a few sacks of meal, of which some baked bread.
The body of the army lay on the hill above the house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">15 April</div>

<div class="sidenote">16 April</div>

<p>Next morning the whole army was drawn up in order of battle a
little nearer Nairn than where the battle was fought, much in the
same order as on the day following. In this situation they continued
all day without meat or drink, only a biscuet to each man at 12
o'clock. About 7 at night they encamped on a dry hill without tents,
being cold and hungry. Great numbers being dispersed through the
country, many of them did not return. That night, betwixt 8 and 9,
orders were given for their marching, with an intention to surprize
the enemy in their camp. The word was King James. The attack was
to be made with sword and pistol. They marched in one column, by
which the rear was near a mile from the front, each rank [<em>fol.</em>
158.] consisting of 33 men only. Many were so much fatigued that
they slept on the march. Others to a great number wandered, and
by the time they came within three miles of Nairn, a person of
distinction,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a
href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> observing the state
of the army, and fearing all there would be cut off, told Lord George
Murray the condition the army was in, and to prevent the loss of so
many gallant men wished he would retreat in time. Lord George Murray
was of his opinion, but, for reasons he gave him, desired he might
inform the Prince of their situation, and bring him orders, which
he undertook. But before he could return with the Prince's orders,
Lord George Murray, observing day coming on, began to retreat, which
occasioned some reflections, and confirmed several in their opinion
formerly of him, though, I believe, without any just foundation.
We came to Culloden about 9 next morning, being April 16th. The
provisions being all spent, the Prince ordered each colonel to send
some of their officers to Inverness with money to buy such as could
be got, and sent orders to the inhabitants to send provisions to the
army, otherwise he would burn the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16 April</div>

<p>Before the Prince left Inverness, on certain intelligence that
Cumberland had passed the Spey, Major Kennedy went to Mr.
John Hay who, in Mr. Murray's absence, officiated as Secretary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and told him that as the enemy was on their march towards
them it was more than probable there would be a battle; and
as the event was very uncertain, it was prudent to guard against
the worst. They might get the better or be defeated. In this
situation he wish'd he would propose to the Prince his sending
a large quantity of provisions then in Inverness to some distance
[<em>fol.</em> 159.]
that, in case of the worst, scattered troops might join
and have wherewithal to subsist them till rejoin'd by such as
had not returned from their commands they had been out
upon. If this was not done all must disperse, the cause must
be given up, and the Prince behov'd to be in danger; for the
neighbourhood of that country could not supply the smallest
number of men for one week. Mr. Hay said nothing, nor do
I believe he ever mentioned it to the Prince. But to return.</p>

<p>The Prince intended to give the army an hearty meal and a
day's rest, and to fight next morning. But being inform'd that
Cumberland's army was within half a mile, he resolved to fight
that day. Lord George Murray and the chiefs of the clans,
especially Lochiel, were against it. However they complied,
though it was their opinion to keep the ground they were on
and receive Cumberland, if he attack'd them, which they were
still in doubt of. Our army came to the height of the muir
before Cumberland came in view. The Prince ordered the
men to be immediately formed in order of battle, but Lord
George Murray begged to have a little time to view the ground
and observe the motions of the enemy. Cumberland soon
appear'd and was forming his men, on which ours began to
form by the Prince's orders, who all the while stood with
Lochiel and Mr. Sullivan, frequently complaining they were long
in forming. A little after they were formed we observed the
[<em>fol.</em> 160.]
horse and the Argileshire men on the left of the enemy drawing
to a distance from the main body and inclining to our right,
on which the Athol and Cameron officers were afraid to be
flanked. This made Lochiel send to Lord George Murray,
then on the left with the Duke of Perth, to tell him of the
danger. Lord George Murray (whom I heard formerly say
that the park would be of great service to prevent our being
flanked) on this took a narrower view of it, and sent three
gentlemen, viz., Colonel Sullivan, John Roy Stewart, and Ker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of Grydan to view it down to the Water of Nairn. At their
return they said it was impossible for any horse to come by
that way. The men still believed they might be flanked, and
some proposed lining the park wall. The Duke of Perth, who
came from the left, was of their opinion. But Lord George
Murray, thinking otherwise, ordered Lord Ogilvie's regiment to
cover the flank, told there was no danger, and to Lord Ogilvie
said, he hoped and doubted not but he would acquit himself
as usual.</p>

<p>The Prince, who with a body of horse was in the rear of the
French, sent 8 or 10 times to Lord George Murray to begin
the attack on the right; but that was not obeyed. He sent
Sir John MacDonald to the Duke of Perth, who moved
immediately with the left. The right, observing this, without
orders from Lord George Murray, followed their example.
Lord George behaved himself with great gallantry, lost his
horse, his periwig and bonnet, was amongst the last that left
the field, had several cutts with broadswords in his coat, and
was covered with blood and dirt.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 161.]
The Prince was in the heat of the action, had one of his
grooms killed close by him, the horse he rode on killed by a
musket bullet<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> which struck him within an inch of the Prince's
leg. Some of the Camerons on the right gave way, being
flanked, as they expected, from the park wall, which the Argyleshire
men had broke down. Lochiel endeavoured to rally
them but could not. On which under the greatest concern he
returned to the action and was wounded by a flank shot. Thus
did some of his men desert their chief and the cause they
fought for, who at the battle of Gladesmuir and Falkirk
behaved with so much intrepidity and courage. I more than
once heard Major Kennedy tell that after the Highlanders were
broke and the French engaged, he went to the Prince and
told him they could not hold it long, that some dragoons had
gone from the right and left of the enemy probably to surround
the hill and prevent his escape, and begged he would retire.
In this request he was joined by others. The Prince complied
with great reluctance, retired in good order and in no hurry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>As the action was near over, as has been told, Lochiel was
wounded in both his legs. He was carried out of the field by
four of his men who brought him to a little barn. As they
were taking off his cloaths to disguise him the barn was
surrounded by a party of dragoons, but as they were entring
[<em>fol.</em> 162.]
the barn they were called off, which prevented his being taken.
The dragoons were no sooner out of sight but his four men
carried him out, put him on a horse, and brought him to Clunie's
house in Badenoch, where he continued till next morning, and
then went to Lochabar. When he left the barn he dismist two
of the four men, the other two supported him on the horse.</p>

<p>At a meeting held at Murlagan, near the head of Loch
Arkaig (present Lord Lovat, Lochiel, Mr. Murray, Major
Kennedy, Glenbuicket, Colonel John Roy Stewart, Clanranald,
Barrisdale, Lochgarie, Mr. Alexander MacLeod, Sir Stewart
Threpland, Keppoch's nephew, and Barrisdale's son), it was
agreed that they, viz., Lochiel, Lochgary, Clanranald, and
Barrisdale, should assemble their men at Glenmallie and cross
Lochie, where Clunie and Keppoch's men should join them.
Lochiel got a body of 3 or 400 men, Barrisdale and Lochgerrie
came with about 150 men each; but so soon as
Lochgerrie got pay for his men, he went away, promising to
return in a few days and at the same time to observe the Earl
of Loudon's motions. But neither of these was done, for the
Earl marched thro' Glengarry and had taken Lochiel but for
some of his scouts as shall be told. Barrisdale, before Lord
Loudon came to Achnecarie, told Lochiel he would go and
bring more men, and left his son with a few. Early in the
morning a body of men appear'd marching over a hill, whom
Lochiel believed to be Barrisdale's men; but he was soon
undeceived by some out-scouts he had placed at proper
distances who told him these men were certainly Loudon's, for
they saw red crosses in their bonnets. On this Lochiel dispersed
[<em>fol.</em> 163.]
his men and crossed the loch in a boat which he kept to prevent
his being surprized. It prov'd as he had been told, and he
owed his escape more to the red crosses than Barrisdale's
honesty.</p>

<p>Lord Lovat and others took different routes. Mr. Murray
continued with Lochiel till they came to Lochleven near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Glencoe, and after being there some time Mr. Murray went
from thence to Glenlion. Sir David Murray, Dr. Cameron, and
I went with him. We continued there 12 or 14 days. From
that we went to Glenochie, where he (Murray) was taken very
ill. He desired we should return. Sir David Murray went
south, and we to Lochiel. He bid us tell him that he would
continue about Glenlion till he recovered, and if he could not
in safety get south to provide a ship he would return to him.
But we were soon informed that in 2 or 3 days after we parted
from him he went south. Captain MacNab went with him to
the Braes of Balquidder, and provided him in an horse and
cloaths. I return to the battle.</p>

<p>As to the left of our army I can give no particular account
but that the officers, nobility and gentry, behaved with great
gallantry, in which all there did agree. The Duke of Athol
had been ill at the time the Prince was at Inverness, and so was
not in the action, but before Cumberland came there he left it.
I was told by one that was with him that a little after the
battle he met with John Hay and enquired what was become
of the Prince. To which he replied he was gone off and desired
none to follow him. On which the Duke took the road to
Ruthven of Badenoch, where he met severals of the unfortunate,
who took different roads for their safety.</p>

<p>The Prince, as I have already told, being prevailed on to
[<em>fol.</em> 164.]
retire after the action, went to Invergary, Glengary's house;
but that gentleman and his lady were not at home. However,
he continued there that night without meat, drink, fire or candle
except some firr-sticks and a salmon he brought, which he ate
with gridiron bannocks. He was made believe his loss was
much greater than it was; that Lochiel, Keppoch, and other
leading men of the Highlanders were killed, and was advised by
Sullivan, O'Neil, and John Hay to dismiss all that were then
with him for greater security of his person, as in that situation
he could trust none. Accordingly he dismissed all but the
above three; but whether Sir Thomas Sheridan was then with
him I have not been inform'd. Many would have followed him
after the battle, but were forbid, as the Duke of Athol was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19 April</div>

<p>From Invergary, where he was but one night, the Prince went
by the head of Locharkeig to the west coast, where he<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
embarked for the Island of Uist. How long he continued there at
that time I know not. But from thence he went in an open boat to
the Lewis in order to get a ship to carry him off. But being in
that disappointed he returned to Uist, where he skulked, till he
was informed that Major General Campbell, and a body of Argyleshire
men and others were come to that island. To avoid them he went to
Clanronald's house, continued there no longer than to dress himself
in woman's cloaths, and [<em>fol.</em> 165.] with Miss MacDonald went in an
open boat to the Isle of Sky. In his passage he met with a boat in
which were some of the Argyleshire men, who seeing a small boat with
two men and two women took no notice of them. On his landing in Sky
he sent Miss MacDonald to Lady Margaret MacDonald, Sir Alexander's
lady, to tell her of his being there and to know if he would be
safe in her house if but for one night, as he was the day following
to leave the island. What reception Miss had, or what return was
made, I cannot say with any certainty (it being told in so many
different ways), but certain it is the Prince went that night to Mr.
MacDonald's of Kingsburgh, where he slept very well, and next day in
an open boat left the island with the Laird of Mackinnon and another.
He landed in Moidart, went to Angus MacDonald's house in Boradale,
returned MacKinnon to Sky, changed his own dress, and sent for
Glenaladale of Clanranald's family.</p>

<p>After the battle of Culloden many of the wounded who were
not able to leave the field were that and the next day killed
upon the spot, and few were made prisoners. Cumberland came
to Inverness, where such as had been prisoners were released.
The clans who were at the action dispersed, and such as were
only coming on their march to join the Prince returned. Earl
Cromerty and others were taken prisoners in Sutherland, and
sometime after brought to Inverness. The French surrendred
prisoners; and different parties were sent to take up the
stragglers. After Cumberland had been sometime in Inverness
he ordered Earl Loudon with a good body of men to Lochabar
to prevent our coming to a body and receive such as would
come and deliver up their arms to him. He met with no
[<em>fol.</em> 166.]
opposition, received a great number of arms, and gave protections.
When he was encamped at Moy, three miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Achnacarry (Lochiel's house), where he (Lochiel) had been, and
six miles from Fort-William, Monroe of Culcairn was sent by
Cumberland with a body of men to Earl Loudon with orders
to him to burn Lochiel's house. On receiving these orders he
told Culcairn that as he was to march from thence, he (Culcairn)
might burn it. To which he answered he had done that
already. The Earl, tho' as an officer he with exactness
discharged his duty, yet behav'd with great humanity to the
unfortunate, which I believe made Culcairn execute what he
had no orders for.</p>

<p>At this time or soon after a line was formed from Inverness
to Fort Augustus, from thence to Fort William to prevent the
Prince or any others to escape; as also a line was formed from
the head of Locharkaig to prevent coming in or going out of
Lochabar.</p>

<p>While Cumberland was at Fort Augustus great liberties were
taken by some officers sent on different commands, particularly
Colonel Cornwallis, Major Lockheart, Monroe of Culcairn,
Captain Caroline Scott, and Captain Grant, son to Grant of
Knockando and Strathspey. Culcairn, after he had burnt and
plundered from Moy to the head of Locharkeig, marched from
thence to Kintale. Captain Grant, above mentioned, with
about 200 men of Loudon's regiment, marched into Lochabar,
stripped men, women, and children without distinction of condition
or sex. He burnt Cameron of Cluns's house, took a few
cows he had bought after Culcairn had formerly plundered him
of all, stript his wife and some others naked as they came into
[<em>fol.</em> 167.]
the world.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Thus was this unfortunate gentleman made partner
in the miseries of his wife and children and deprived of all
means of subsistence except five milk goats. From thence he
marched by the wood of Tervalt to Locharkeig. He told he
was going to carry off Barrisdale's cattle who had undertaken to
apprehend the Prince, but had deceived them; which was owing
more to its not being in his power than want of inclination. He
burnt and plunder'd as he marched. The day he left Cluns he
apprehended one Alexander Cameron, on the side of Locharkeig,
who had a gun on his shoulder. This man, tho' he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the party at a distance made no attempt to run from them
but came and delivered his arms. Being asked how he came
not to deliver his arms sooner, he answered he saw these
who had submitted to the King's mercy plundered as well as
those who did not; that he had gone with his wife and children
and cattle to a remote wilderness, which was the reason he had
not delivered up his arms before that time. This to any but
Captain Grant would have been a sufficient excuse, but so void
was he of the least humanity that he ordered him immediately
to be tied to a tree and shot dead by the highway in the wood
of Muick. This party was joined in Knoidart by Monroe of
Culcairn, who commanded 200 men and had been in Kintail.
About eight days after, as they were returning with Barrisdale's
cattle and some belonging to others, Culcairn was shot from a
[<em>fol.</em> 168.]
bush, not a gun-shot length or distance from that spot where
Cameron had been (it may be said) murdered by Captain Grant.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Evan MacHoule or Cameron, tho' he never had been out of the
country or join'd the Prince's army or any part of it, came to
deliver his arms to the first party that came to Lochabar then
at the head of Locharkeig. He was desired to tell where arms
were hid. He declared he knew not where any were hid with
asseverations and oaths. But these did not save him, for he was
immediately shot. I do not remember who commanded the
party, but I believe it was Colonel Cornwallis. Archibald
MacLauchlan, brother to John MacLauchlan of Greenhall, was
an officer in that command. William Dow MacHoule and his
brother going to a sheeling in Glenkengie were taken up on
suspicion that one of the black horses was in their custody, and
for this aggravating circumstance, viz., that a gun was found
in one of their houses, were both immediately shot.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The last
that encamped in the Braes of Locharkeig, seeing what they
believed to be a boat on the side of the loch, sent a party. But it
proved to be no other than a large black stone. But that they
might not return without some gallant action, on meeting a poor
old man about sixty, begging, they shot him. Much about the
same time meeting a poor old woman, blind of an eye, a beggar
for several years before, they desired her to tell where Lochiel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was; and for not telling what she did not know she was
immediately shot. This is certain; but what is reported to
have been done to her before she was dead I incline not to
[<em>fol.</em> 169.]
repeat&mdash;things shocking to human nature. Colonel Cornwallis,
when sent with a large body of men to the head of Locharkeig,
in his march thro' Grant of Glenmoriston's country spied two
men leading dung to their land. They were ordered to come
to the party, but happening to turn their backs upon it they
were instantly shot dead. John Cameron, brother to Lochiel,
never join'd him or any of his servants. On the contrary when
the Prince came to Glenfinan or before it, he went to his
father-in-law, John Campbell's house in Broadalbin, where he
continued till the Prince marched out of Lochabar, and so soon
as he returned he waited upon Captain Campbell, deputy
governor of Fort William, continued some days with him and
ever behaved himself peaceably, keeping at home. But that
could not save his effects; for Captain Caroline Scott, the last
that plundered that unfortunate country, took from him an
hundred of his cows and all his small and young cattle. An order
being given to apprehend, on suspicion, Peter MacLauchlan,
taxman of a farm in Mull, belonging to the Duke of Argyle,
he came within the time limited in Cumberland's proclamation,
at least as soon as he was informed of it and surrendred himself
and arms to Major General Campbell. But how soon the
[<em>fol.</em> 170.]
general went to the Isles, Captain Millar of Guise's regiment,
formerly a prize-fighter, was sent with a party to Mull, as is
believed by orders of Captain Caroline Scott, to burn and
plunder some few tenants in MacKinnon's lands; which being
done with great severity, he went to Peter MacLauchlan's house,
burnt it, plundered everything that he had, horses, cows, and
sheep, except a lame cow that could not travell.</p>

<p>Captain Caroline Scott came to Stewart of Ardsheill's house
in Appin and took from his lady a few cows General Campbell
had bought from the soldiers and made a present of to her.
All Ardsheil's cattle being taken by the soldiers, the Captain
desired she would give him her keys, which she did. He then
demanded what he called her small keys which she had no sooner
delivered than he offered her his hand, led her out of the house,
and told her she had no more to do in it. She desired to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
where she was to go. He replied to Appin's house. She then
told him she could not leave her young children to starve, as
he had taken all her provisions from her. On which he ordered
her one boll of meal of her own to be given her. The Captain,
after he had rummaged the house, took great care to have the
slates and sarking taken from the roof. He gutted the house
and office-houses of all the timber in them with the least damage
possible even to the drawing of the nails. He then had all the
walls cast down, the free stone, lintels, rabats, etc., laid by
themselves, all which he sold with the planting, which chiefly
[<em>fol.</em> 171.]
consisted of many large ash trees. It was this Captain Caroline
who hanged three men near Glenevis, that when some others
were pursued, came and delivered their arms, expecting to get
protection. In place of which the Captain told them, as others
had not done the same they were to be hang'd. The poor men
said it would be hard to punish them for the fault of others;
and so little did they think he intended any such thing, but
that he threatened to fright them, they were laughing when
the soldiers were putting the ropes about their necks. But they
were mistaken; for instantly they were hang'd and had not so
much time as to beg God to have mercy upon their souls.</p>

<p>The same Captain, when he went to the island of Barra with
a party to search for arms, he apprehended a man, being informed
that he had been in arms, and ordered him immediately
to be hang'd. The poor man begg'd he might delay for a few
hours that he would prove by 50 he had never been out of the
country or under arms in it. But this was not granted, tho'
Captain Millar of Guise's regiment begged he might consider
what he was doing&mdash;for tho' he (Scott) was an older Captain,
yet he had served much longer. To which the other replied
he knew very well what he was doing, which was not without
orders. What made this the more surprizing is that tho' in
the islands belonging to Barra there will be about 4 or 500
souls there is but one gentleman and 7 or 8 common people
that are Protestants, of whom this poor unfortunate man was
one.</p>

<p>I have hitherto confin'd myself to facts; but in this place
must observe that all those who were hang'd or shot were Protestants;
[<em>fol.</em> 172.]
that in plundering the cattle, burning, etc., the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Roman Catholick's countries, Braes of Lochabar, Glengary,
Knoidart, Moidart, Arisaig, and Morar suffer'd little by burning
or taking of cattle, and not one that I know of was hang'd
or shot who was a Papist. How loud would the clamour have
been had such burning and murders, etc., been committed by
the Prince's army, or the like indulgence shown to Popish
countries and Papists!</p>

<p>I have been told Major Lockheart came not short of Captain
Caroline in many of the like actions. But as I was not then
in that country, I leave it to others better informed. What I
have told of the above plunderings, burnings, and killing may
be absolutely depended on; and have left off to put them
together, lest, if mention'd in their proper places, it might
interrupt what more particularly concern'd the Prince, to
which I return.</p>

<p>Glenaladale, as I have related, being sent for, came; and the
Prince being better inform'd as to Lochiel, Keppoch, and
others, that his loss had not been as Sullivan and O'Neil told
him, proposed going to Lochabar where he believed Lochiel
was. But as all the passes were then guarded, this was represented
to be impracticable. He continued a few days in that
country and was advised to go to the Braes of Glenmoriston,
and there and in Lord Lovat's country to continue till the
passes were opened. Accordingly he went attended by Glenaladale,
his brother, and a son of Angus MacDonald's, two
young boys. They sent for Donald Cameron of Glenpean to
be their guide to the Braes of Locharkeig. He came, and in
the night conducted the Prince safe thro' the guards that were
on the pass so close to their tents as to hear every word they
spoke.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> When they came to Glenmoriston they got six stout
trusty men, but spoke not a word of English, with whom and
Glenaladale the Prince continued betwixt the Braes of Glenmoriston
[<em>fol.</em> 173.]
and Glen Strathferrar till the guards were removed
and all the passes opened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 Aug.</div>

<p>About the beginning of August he went to Lochabar with
the above retinue, came to Achnasual on the side of Locharkeig,
two miles from Achnacarie. They had no provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
but expected to be supplied in that country, in which they
were disappointed, it having been plundered, and all the
people were fled to the mountains to save their lives. In this
situation the Prince was in danger of being starved, when one
of the Glenmoriston men discovered a large fine hart and shot
him. The day following the Prince was inform'd that Lochgarie,
Cluns, and Achnasual were in the neighbouring mountains,
and sent for them, and dispatched one to inform Lochiel,
then about 20 miles distant, of his being in that country. But
Lochiel, some days before, hearing a surmise of the Prince's
being come to the continent had sent his brother (the doctor)
and me by different roads to get all the intelligence we could
of the Prince. The person who was sent to Lochiel met the
Doctor within a few miles of the place where Lochiel was, who
was obliged to return with two French officers that were likewise
in quest of the Prince.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>This faithful person would not own he knew anything about
the Prince, his orders being only to tell Lochiel. However, he
said he had business of the utmost consequence. The Doctor
brought him and the two officers to his brother. The next
day Lochiel sent the Doctor to the Prince, and the officers to
the care of one of his friends with whom they were to continue
till further orders. In the mean time, after travelling and
searching several days to no purpose, I met the Doctor at
Achnacarie as he was going to the Prince. He had four servants
with him, who, as the river was not passable, raised a
[<em>fol.</em> 174.]
boat Culcairn had sunk after his searching the Isle of Locharkeig,
where from former experience he expected to get a great
deal of plunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August</div>

<p>When Culcairn was in this island he discovered some new-raised
earth, and believing money or arms to be hid there
had it dug up, and only discovered the corpse of a man without
a coffin, which had not been many days buried. On the
corps there was a good Holland shirt, which made him believe
it to be Lochiel, and sent an express to Cumberland to tell
that he had found Lochiel's corps, who had died of his wounds.
From this it was put in the newspapers. This was the corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of John Cameron, brother to Allan Cameron of Callart, who
was taken at Culloden and sent prisoner to London. The
shirt was taken from the corps and it left to be food for the
birds of prey, etc.</p>

<p>The Prince at this time was in a small hutt built for the
purpose in the wood betwixt Achnasual and the end of Locharkeig.
Observing some men in arms by the water side, we sent
two of Cluns' children to know who they were. We soon discovered
them to belong to Cluns, sent the boat for them, and
dismist the four servants on pretence we were going to skulk
in the wood for some days; and that keeping such a number
together might be dangerous. We cross'd the river and went
to the hutt. The Prince with Achnasual had gone a little
from it; but being informed what we were, came immediately
to us. He was then bare-footed, had an old black kilt coat
on, a plaid, philabeg and waistcoat, a dirty shirt and a long
red beard, a gun in his hand, a pistol and durk by his side.
He was very cheerful and in good health, and, in my opinion,
fatter than when he was at Inverness.</p>

<p>When we told him what we were and from whence we came,
and that Lochiel was well and recovered of his wounds,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> he
[<em>fol.</em> 175.]
thanked God thrice for it, and expressed an uncommon satisfaction.
They had kill'd a cow the day before, and the servants
were roasting some of it with speets. The Prince knew
their names, spoke in a familiar way to them and some Erse.
He ate very heartily of the roasted beef and some bread we
had got from Fort Augustus, and no man could sleep sounder
in the night than he. He proposed going immediately where
Lochiel was. But we knew by the newspapers the Government
had been inform'd some time before that he had pass'd
Corierag with Lochiel and 30 men, which probably might
occasion a search in those parts. This made him resolve to
continue for some time where he was. Some days after Lochgary
and the Doctor were sent to Lochiel and Glenaladale,
and the faithful Glenmoriston men were dismist. The Prince
continued in the hutt with Cluns's children. Captain MacRaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of Glengary's regiment, one or two servants, and I had the
honour to add one to the number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<div class="sidenote">August</div>

<p>The two officers who, I told, went to Lochiel with the
Doctor, came from Dunkirk in a small vessel with sixty other
young gentlemen, who had formed themselves in a company
of volunteers under the command of the foresaid two officers,
some time before they could hear of the battle of Culloden.
They came in June to Polliew in Seaforth's country, where
four of them landed to deliver their dispatches, of whom two
were taken; and the other two wandered in Seaforth's country
till Lochgarie, hearing they had letters for the Prince, sent
[<em>fol.</em> 176.]
Captain MacRaw and his own servant for them, that they
might be sent to Lochiel, since the Prince was not to be found.
This happen'd about the middle of July. When they came to
Lochiel they told him they had left their papers with Mr.
Alexander MacLeod, one of the Prince's aid de camps, then
skulking in Seaforth's country. Tho' this prov'd true, yet as
they themselves had not told it to Lochgary or any other,
made him (Lochiel) suspect them to be Government spies.
The Prince wanted much to see them. But we told him what
Lochiel and we were afraid of, which made him resolve to act in
this with greater caution. He said it was surprizing that two
men, strangers, and without one word of Earse, could escape from
the troops, who were always in motion in quest of him and his
followers. But to see them in safety, he wrote a letter to them
himself to this purpose,&mdash;that to avoid falling into the hands
of his enemies he was under a necessity to retire to a remote
country where he had none with him but one, Captain Drummond,
and a servant, and as he could not remove from where
he was without danger to himself and them, he had sent Captain
Drummond with this letter; and as he could repose
entire confidence in him, desired whatever message they had
to him, to tell it to the bearer, Captain Drummond, and take
his advice as to their conduct. This letter he proposed to
deliver to them himself under the name of Captain Drummond,
for both of them told Lochiel they had never seen the Prince.
They were sent for, and when they came, were introduced to
the Prince under his borrowed name. He delivered the letter
to them with which they were very well pleased, and told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
everything they had to say, which he afterwards said was of
[<em>fol.</em> 177.]
no great consequence as his affairs then stood. They continued
two days with us, asked the fictitious Captain Drummond
several questions about the Prince's health and manner
of living. His answers they heard with the utmost surprize.
The Prince, believing the pacquet left with Mr. Alexander
MacLeod might be of use to him, sent for it; but as it was
cyphers and directed to the French ambassador, he could make
nothing of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">11 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">13 Aug.</div>

<p>We continued in this wood and that over against Achnacarie
(having three hutts in different places to which we removed by
turns) till I think about the 10th of August, on which day
Cluns's son and I went to the Strath of Cluns for intelligence.
We were not half an hour in the hut, which Cluns had built for
his family (after his house was burnt), when a child of six years
old went out and returned in haste to tell that she saw a great
body of soldiers. This we did not believe, as Lochgary had
promised to Lochiel to have a guard betwixt Fort Augustus
and this place to give intelligence. We went out to know the
truth and it proved as the girl had said. Cluns skulked to
observe the motions of the party. His son and I went to
inform the Prince. He was that day in one of the hutts on
the other side of the Water Kiaig a short mile from Cluns.
Crossing the ford of that water under cover of the wood, and
coming within pistol shot of the hutt, I observed the party
advancing. The Prince was then asleep, being about 8 in the
morning. I wakened him and desired him not to be surprized,
for that a body of the enemy were in sight. He with the
utmost composure got up, called for his gun, sent for Captain
MacRaw and Sandy, Cluns's son, who with a servant were doing
the duty of sentries about the wood. We concluded by our
having no intelligence of the party marching from Fort
[<em>fol.</em> 178.]
Augustus, as had been promised, there was treachery in it and
that we were surrounded. Cluns came soon up to where we
were. However tho' but eight in number we were determined,
rather than to yield, to be butchered by our merciless enemies
to sell our lives dear and in defence of our Prince to die like
men of honour. We left the hut and marched to a small hill
above the wood from whence we could see a great way up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Glenkingie and not be discovered. We got there unobserved,
which was owing to the cover of the wood. The Prince
examined all our guns, which were in pretty good order, and
said he hoped we would do some execution before we were
killed. For his part he was bred a fowler, and could charge
quick, was a tolerable marksman, and would be sure of one, at
least. He said little more, but sent Cluns and me to take a
narrow view of the party, and resolved that night to goe to the
top of Mullantagart, a very high mountain in the Braes of
Glenkengie, and to send one to us to know what we discover'd
or were informed of. When we came to the Strath of Cluns
the women told us that the party was of Lord Loudon's
regiment, consisting of about 200 men, commanded by one
Captain Grant, son to Grant of Knockando in Strathspey; that
they had carried away ten milk cows which Cluns had bought
after he was plundered, and found out the hutt we had in the
wood of Tervalt, and that they gave it out that they were going
to bring Barrisdale's cattle to the camp, who had promised to
apprehend the Prince but had deceived them. I have told you
[<em>fol.</em> 179.]
already how this Captain Grant, I may say, barbarously
murdered Alexander Cameron on the side of Locharkeig. In
the evening Cluns' son came to us from the Prince, with whom
we returned, told him as we were informed, and brought some
whiskie, bread, and cheese. This was about 12 at night. He
was on the side of the mountain without fire or any covering.
We persuaded him to take a hearty dram and made a fire,
which we durst not keep above half an hour lest it should be
seen by the people in the neighbourhood. By daylight we
went to the top of the mountain, where we continued till eight
in the evening without the least cover, and durst not rise out
of our seats. The Prince slept all the forenoon in his plaid and
wet hose, altho' it was an excessive cold day, made more so by
several showers of hail. From thence we went that night to the
Strath of Glenkengie, killed a cow and lived merrily for some
days. From that we went to the Braes of Achnacarie. The
Water of Arkeg in crossing came up to our haunches. The
Prince in that condition lay that night and next day in open
air, and though his cloaths were wet he did not suffer the least
in his health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">13 Sept.</div>

<p>In a day or two after Lochgary and Dr. Cameron return'd
from Lochiel (to whom they had been sent) and told it was
Lochiel's opinion and theirs that the Prince would be safe where
he (Lochiel) was skulking. This pleased him much and the
next night he set out with Lochgary, the Doctor and Sandy
(Cluns's son), myself and three servants. We travell'd in the
night and slept all day, till we came to Lochiel, who was then
in the hills betwixt the Braes of Badenoch and Athol. The
Doctor and I went by another road on a message to Badenoch.
I return'd about September 13th and the next day was sent
south. The Prince by moving from place to place and but few
with him had hitherto escaped the narrow and strict search of
[<em>fol.</em> 180.]
the troops. But as the like good fortune might not always
continue he ordered Lochiel to send south to have a ship
freighted to bring him and others off by the East Coast. The
ship was provided, and one sent to inform the Prince of it, who
with Lochiel and others was to come where the ship lay. But
before this messenger came to where the Prince had been, two
of Lochiel's friends that had orders to watch on the West
Coast came and told that two French ships were arrived at
Moidart. Upon this, the night following, the Prince set out
from where they were, and at the same time sent to inform
others skulking in different places. Some arrived in time;
but others by some accident or other had not that good
fortune.</p>

<p>I have told you what I was witness to or informed of by such
as I could absolutely depend upon. I shall only add that the
Prince submitted with patience to his adverse fortune, was
chearful, and frequently desired those that were with him to be
so. He was cautious when in the greatest danger, never at a loss
in resolving what to do, with uncommon fortitude. He regretted
more the distress of those who suffered for adhering to his
interest than the hardships and dangers he was hourly exposed
to. To conclude, he possesses all the virtues that form the
character of a <span class="smcap">Hero</span> and <span class="smcap">Great Prince</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Captain O'Neil's Journal</span> of the Prince's Retreat
and Escape after April 16th, 1746.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">15 April</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 181.] April 15th.&mdash;The Prince marched his army in three columns
from Culloden Muir to surprize the Duke of Cumberland in
his camp at Nairn, ordering at the same time 2000 men to pass
the river Nairn and post themselves between Elgin and the
camp of the enemy. To deceive the ships in Inverness Road,
we made several fires on the mountain, where we drew up in
battle order, and at 8 o'clock at night we began our march.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16 April</div>

<p>About 2 o'clock next morning (April 16th) within a mile of
the enemy our van halted. The Prince, who marched in the
centre, dispatched an aid de camp to know the motive of the
halt. Colonel O'Sullivan, who marched in the van, immediately
hasted to the Prince, and told him. Lord George Murray and
some others of the chiftains, as they wanted some of their men,
did not think themselves sufficiently strong to attack the
enemy, and, upon a strong belief that the Duke of Cumberland
was apprized of their design, refused to advance, maugrè the
instances he (Sullivan) made use of to engage them to the
contrary. Upon this the Prince advanced to the head of the
column, where, assembling the chiefs, in the most pathetic
manner and strongest terms he demonstrated to them the
visible and real advantages they had of an enemy who thought
themselves secure of any such attempt; and descending from
his horse, drew his sword and told them, he would head them
to an enemy they had as often defeated as seen. But deaf to
his example and intreaties the greater part declined, which so
sensibly shocked the Prince that, remounting his horse, he told
them, with tears in his eyes, that he did not so much regret his
own loss as their inevitable ruine. We immediately march'd
back to our camp at Culloden where we arriv'd at 5 in the
[<em>fol.</em> 182.]
morning. At ten o'clock we were inform'd that the Duke of
Cumberland was in full march towards us. The Prince on this
report gave the necessary orders for the attack, riding from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rank to rank, encouraging his troops and exhorting them to
behave as formerly at Prestonpans and Falkirk; and between
12 and one we began the attack and engaged the enemy, the
Prince commanding the centre. Our right wing immediately
broke the left of the enemy; but their flank being exposed to
nine squadrons of horse, who attacked them when in pursuit of
the foot, put them into so much confusion that they instantly
dispersed. The Prince, galloping to the right and endeavouring
to rally them, but to no purpose, had his horse shot under
him.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The left followed the example of the right which drew
on an entire flight, maugrè all the Prince could do to animate
or rather rally them. He remain'd on the field of battle till
there were no more hopes left, and then scarce could be
persuaded to retire, ordering the French picquets and Fitz-James's
horse to make a stand in order to favour the retreat of
the Highlanders, which was happily effected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26 April</div>

<p>Previous to the battle the Prince ordered the chiftains in
case of a defeat, as the Highlanders could not retreat as regular
troops, to assemble their men near Fort Augustus. In consequence
of which immediately after the battle the Prince
dispatched me to Inverness to repeat his orders to such of his
troops as were there. That night the Prince retired six miles
from the field of battle, and next day arrived at Fort Augustus,
[<em>fol.</em> 183.]
where he remained all that day in expectation his troops would
have join'd him. But seeing no appearance of it he went to
the house of Invergary and ordered me to remain there to direct
such as passed by that way the road his royal highness took. I
remained there two days and did the Prince's orders to such as
I met; but to no effect, every one taking his own road. I
then followed the Prince, who was so far from making a
precipitate retreat that he retired by six and six miles, and
arrived the 26th of April at Knoidart, where I join'd him next
day and gave him an account of the little appearance there was
of assembling his troops. Upon which he wrote circuler letters
to all the Chiftains, enjoining them by the obedience they
owed him to join him immediately with such of their
clans as possibly they could gather together; at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
time representing the imminent danger they were in if they
neglected it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27 April</div>

<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<p>After remaining there some days in hopes his orders would
have been obeyed, and seeing not one person resort to him,
the extreme danger of his person was remonstrated to him,
being within 7 miles of Lord Loudoun, Sir Alexander MacDonald
and the MacLeods; and to evade this it was proposed
to retreat to one of the islands near the continent. After
repeated instances of the like nature he reluctantly assented,
leaving Mr. John Hay behind to transmit him the answers of
his letters with an account of what passed; and departed for
the Isles in an open fishing boat at 8 o'clock that night,
accompanied by Colonel O'Sullivan and me. About an hour
[<em>fol.</em> 184.]
after we set out a violent storm arose, which drove us ninety
miles from our intended port; and next day running for
shelter into the island of North Uist, we struck upon a rock,
the boat staved to pieces, and with the greatest difficulty we
saved our lives. At our landing we were in the most melancholy
situation, knowing nobody and wanting the common
necessaries of life. After much search we found a little hut
uninhabited and took shelter there, and with great difficulty
made a fire to dry our cloaths. Here we remained two days,
having no other provisions but a few biscuit we had saved out
of the boat, which were entirely spoiled with the salt water.
As this island belonged to Sir Alexander MacDonald, and not
judging ourselves safe, we determined on going elsewhere; and
by the greatest good fortune one of our boatmen discovered a
boat stranded on the coast, and having with great difficulty
launched her in the water we embarked for the Harris. In
our passage we unfortunately met with another storm, which
obliged us to put into an island near Stornoway. Next day
the Prince dispatched me for the Harris to look out for a ship,
ordering me to embark on board the first I could get, and to
make the most diligent haste after my landing on the continent
to the Court of France, enjoining me to give a most
exact account to his most Christian Majesty of his disasters,
and of his resolution never to abandon the country untill he
knew the final result of France; and if possible once more to
assemble his faithful Highlanders. Unluckily the person his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
royal highness sent with me getting drunk told the master of
the ship somewhat that induced him to refuse taking me on
[<em>fol.</em> 185.]
board, and immediately alarm'd the country, which obliged me
to retreat and join the Prince, who, when I told him, resolved
for the continent by way of Seaforth's country. But the boatmen
absolutely refused to comply, which made us take the
road we came; and meeting with three ships of war we were
constrain'd to retire to a desart island, where we remained
eight days in the greatest misery, having no sustenance but
dried fish Providence threw in on the island.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> When the ships
disappeared we put out to sea, and next morning we met with
another, just coming out of one of the lochs who pursued us
near an hour; but the wind rising we made our escape. In
the afternoon we arrived at the island of Benbicula, and one
of the boatmen being acquaint with a herd of the island, we
all went to his house, where passing for friends of the boatman
we remain'd four days, and then the Prince sent the boat to
the continent with an Highland gentleman whom he charged
with letters to the chiefs, Secretary Murray and John Hay,
requiring an exact account how affairs stood. Not thinking
ourselves secure in the cottage, by the advice of a friend we
retired to the mountain of Corradale to wait the return of the
gentleman, where we remained 22 days, when the gentleman
returned with a letter from Secretary Murray importing that
almost all the clans had delivered up themselves and arms,
and consequently they were no more to be depended upon. He
[<em>fol.</em> 186.]
likewise acquainted the Prince of two French ships which had
arrived at the continent with money and arms, and in which
the Duke of Perth and his brother, Sir Thomas Sheridan and
John Hay had embark'd for France. Here we remained for
some days longer till the Duke of Cumberland, having intelligence
the Prince was concealed in the Long Island, ordered
the militia of the Isle of Sky and the independent companies
to go in search of him. As soon as we had notice of their
landing we retreated to an island about twelve miles distance,
called Hoya, where we remained till we found they had followed
us. We then went for Loch Boysdale and staid there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
for eight days, where Captain Caroline Scott landed within a
mile of us, which obliged us to separate, the Prince and I
taking to the mountains, and Sullivan remaining with the
boatmen. At fall of night we marched towards Benbicula,
being inform'd Scott had ordered the militia to come and join
him. At midnight we came to a hutt where by good fortune
we met with Miss Flora MacDonald, whom I formerly knew.
I quitted the Prince at some distance from the hut, and went
myself with a design of being inform'd if the independent
companies were to pass that way next day as we had been
informed. The young lady answered in the negative, saying
they would not pass till the day after. I then told her I
brought a friend to see her. She with some emotion asked if
it was the Prince. I answered in the affirmative and instantly
brought him in. We then consulted on the immediate danger
the Prince was in, and could think of no more proper or safe
[<em>fol.</em> 187.]
place or expedient than to propose to Miss Flora to convey
him to the Isle of Sky, where her mother lived. This seem'd
the more feasable, as the young lady's father being captain of
an independent company would afford her a pass for herself
and servant to go visit her mother. The Prince assented
and immediately proposed it to the young lady, to which she
answered with the greatest respect and loyalty but declined,
saying, Sir Alexander MacDonald was too much her friend to
be the instrument of his ruine. I endeavoured to obviate this
by assuring her Sir Alexander was not in the country, and
that she could with the greatest facility convey the Prince to
her mother's house, as she lived close by the water side.</p>

<p>I then remonstrated to her the honour and immortality that
would redound to her by such a glorious action; and she at
length acquiesced, after the Prince had told her the sense he
would always retain of so conspicuous a service. She promised
to acquaint us next day when things were ripe for execution,
and we parted for the mountain of Corradale. Next day at 4
in the afternoon we received a message from our protectrix
telling us all was well. We determined joining her immediately,
but the messenger told us we could not pass any of
the fords that separated the island we were in from Benbicula,
as they were both guarded. In this dilemma a man of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
country tendred his boat to us, which we readily accepted of;
and next day landed at Benbicula, and immediately marched
for Rushness, the place of rendezvous, where we arrived at
midnight, and instead of our protectrix found a guard of the
enemy. We were constrain'd to retreat four miles, having eat
nothing for 34 hours before. The Prince ordered me to go to
[<em>fol.</em> 188.]
the lady and know the reason she did not keep her appointment.
She told me she had engaged a cousin of hers in North
Uist to receive him into his house, where she was sure he
would be more safe than in the Isle of Sky.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> I immediately
dispatched a boy with these news to the Prince and mentioned
to him the place of appointment, whither his royal highness
came. But the gentleman absolutely refused to receive us,
alleging for a motive he was a vassal to Sir Alexander
MacDonald. In this unexpected exigence, being within a small
half mile of a captain and 50 men, we hasted for Rushness,
being apprized the enemy had just abandoned it. The Prince
sent me to acquaint Miss Flora of our disappointment, and to
intreat her to keep by her promise as there was no time to be
lost. She faithfully promised next day. I remained with her
that night, the Prince remaining at Rushness attended by a
little herd boy. Next day I accompanied Miss Flora to the
place of rendezvous, where we had not long been when we had
an account that General Campbell was just landed with 1500
men. We now were apprehensive we were betrayed and
instantly got to our boat and put to another place, where we
arrived at daybreak. We then dispatched a person to Clanronald's
house to learn what news, who brought us word that
General Campbell was there with Captain Ferguson, and that
he saw Captain Scott's detachment coming to join them, and
that they amounted in all to 2300 men.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 189.] The Prince intreated the young lady that I should accompany
him, but she absolutely refused it, having a pass but for
one servant. His royal highness was so generous as to decline
going unless I attended him, untill I told him that if he made
the least demur I would instantly go about my business, as I
was extremely indifferent what became of myself, provided his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
person was safe. He at length embarked, attended only by
Miss Flora MacDonald, etc.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Remarks</span>, etc., and <small>PARTICULAR SAYINGS</small> of some
who were concerned in the <span class="smcap">Prince's preservation</span>.
Leith, Citadel, July 20, 1747.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">1747
20 July</div>
<p>Tis pity that Captain O'Neil has not been more particular
in his journal, for he has not so much as mentioned the necessity
the Prince was in to disguise himself in a female dress,
which serves to explain his distress and danger as much as any
thing can do. Besides by studying too much brevity he has
altogether omitted several remarkable particulars which he
minutely described to those he conversed familiarly with both
in the Castle of Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and after he was set at liberty.
He used to tell that when he was along with the Prince they
happen'd to be twice within a gun-shot of parties of the enemy,
[<em>fol.</em> 190.]
that he quite despair'd of being any longer kept out of their
clutches, and that he failed not to represent to the Prince the
impossibility of not falling into the enemy's hands. 'The
Prince,' said he, 'always reproved me for my desponding thoughts,
and endeavoured to encourage me in times of the greatest
danger by saying, "O'Neil, is this all the faith and trust you
have in God? Let us only take care to have enough of faith
and trust in his providence and there is no fear of us at all.
Pull up your spirits, man. Never despair."' O'Neil frankly
own'd that in place of his being useful to the Prince by
endeavouring to comfort and support him when dangers
thicken'd upon them, the Prince had the like good offices to
perform to him, and that he frequently exerted himself in
different shapes to raise his spirits. One time having nothing
to eat for about two days but some mouldy dirty crumbs in
O'Neil's pocket, they luckily happened at last to come to a
very mean cottage where they found only an old poor woman
who received them kindly, and gave each of them two eggs
and a piece of bear-bannocks, but having not so much in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hut as a cup of cold water to give them to put down their
morsel, she told them that some lasses had lately gone up the
hill to milk the goats, etc., and that if they would follow
them, probably they might have a drink of milk from them.
The advice was very seasonable, and away they went, the
honest old woman directing them the way they should go.
[<em>fol.</em> 191.]
The Prince skipped so speedily up the hill that O'Neil could
not keep up with him. The lasses gave them plenty of milk,
and poor O'Neil lay along among the grass, being quite undone
with fatigue and fear. The Prince did all he could to
rouse him up both by arguing and joking with him; but all
to no purpose. At last the Prince turning from him, said,
'Come, my lasses, what would you think to dance a Highland
reel with me? We cannot have a bag-pipe just now, but I
shall sing you a Strathspey reel.' The dance went merrily on,
and the Prince skipped so nimbly, knocking his thumbs and
clapping his hands that O'Neil was soon surprized out of his
thoughtful mood, being ashamed to remain any longer in the
dumps when his Prince had been at so much pains to divert
his melancholy. He was sure he said that the Prince entred
into this frolick merely upon his account, for that there could
be no dancing at his heart, seeing at that time they knew not
where to move one foot. The Captain used to say he believed
there was not such another man in all the world as the Prince.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing too that O'Neil has not mentioned his
going on board with O'Sullivan after parting with the Prince,
and how he was taken prisoner upon his coming ashore again
about something they wanted to have, how he was very
[<em>fol.</em> 192.]
roughly used, particularly by some of the Campbells, who took
from him his gold and watch, and every valuable thing about
him, and how he was stript naked and threatened (if he would
not tell where the Prince was to be found) with being put into
that racking machine which Barisdale invented and made use
of to extort confession from thieves, and in which one could
not live above one hour.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> But perhaps the Captain reserves
these and some other points to be the subject-matter of another
Journal when he comes to a country where he can make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
plain declaration of all that he knows with freedom and
safety.</p>

<p>Captain O'Neil had very great difficulty to prevail upon Miss
MacDonald to undertake being guardian to the Prince. She
was not only frighten'd at the hazards and dangers attending
such a bold enterprize, but likewise insisted upon the risque
she would run of losing her character in a malicious and ill-natured
world. The Captain was at some pains to represent
to her the glory and honour she would acquire by such a worthy
and heroic action, and he hoped God would make her successful
in it. 'You need not fear your character,' said he, 'for by
[<em>fol.</em> 193.]
this you will gain yourself an immortal character. But if you
will still entertain fears about your character, I shall (by an
oath) marry you directly, if you please.' After she had consented
O'Neil then thought it a proper time to say something
for himself, and earnestly begged that he himself might have
the happiness of being taken under her tuition. But she
positively refused to grant his request. At last he became so
pressing in his suit that he fell down upon his knees and
prayed her to consider his case and the desire he had to share
in the Prince's fate whatever it should be. She steadily
resisted all his importunities and judiciously remarked to him
that the safety of the Prince depended much upon few being
in company, that she could more easily undertake the preservation
of one than of two or more; and therefore she desired
that he might not insist upon that point, for if he should she
resolv'd not to embark in the affair at all. He found himself
obliged to desist, and owned afterwards upon reflection the
wisdom of her resolution.</p>

<p>Her step-father (Hugh MacDonald of Armadale in Sky) did
really serve her with a passport, although at that time he was
captain of militia, and had a command of Sir Alexander's
men in South Uist in order to prevent the Prince's escape. He
[<em>fol.</em> 194.]
is reckoned the strongest man of all the name of MacDonald,
as I have more than once heard Kingsburgh declare, and his
strength of mind seems to bear proportion to the strength of
his body. He was obliged for some time to keep out of the
way till the suspicion of the passport began to be forgot. But
every one would not have been desirous of the task to lay hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
on him; for he never quit with his arms when he was skulking,
and the people in Sky stood in awe of him. Before they went
to the boat the Prince renewed the request about O'Neil's
going along; but Miss wisely persisted in her former resolution
and would not hear of the proposal, though the Prince
pressed the matter with great earnestness.</p>

<p>In the Journal taken from the mouths of the Laird of
MacKinnon, Malcolm MacLeod, etc., Miss MacDonald has
omitted several things which she particularly mentioned to
those who conversed with her when she was lying in the Road
of Leith on board the <em>Eltham</em> and the <em>Bridgewater</em> ships of
war. She told that when the Prince put on women's cloaths
he proposed carrying a pistol under one of his petticoats for
making some small defence in case of an attack. But Miss
declared against it, alleging that if any person should happen
to search them the pistol would only serve to make a discovery.
[<em>fol.</em> 195.]
To which the Prince replied merrily: 'Indeed, Miss, if we
shall happen to meet with any that will go so narrowly to
work in searching as what you mean they will certainly discover
me at any rate.' But Miss would not hear of any arms
at all, and therefore the Prince was obliged to content himself
with only a short heavy cudgel, with which he design'd to do
his best to knock down any single person that should attack
him.</p>

<p>She us'd likewise to tell that in their passage to the Isle of
Sky a heavy rain fell upon them, which with former fatigues
distressed her much. To divert her the Prince sung several
pretty songs. She fell asleep, and to keep her so, the Prince
still continued to sing. Happening to awake with some little
bustle in the boat she found the Prince leaning over her with
his hands spread about her head. She asked what was the
matter? The Prince told her that one of the rowers being
obliged to do somewhat about the sail behoved to step over
her body (the boat was so small), and lest he should have done
her hurt either by stumbling or trampling upon her in the dark
[<em>fol.</em> 196.]
(for it was night) he had been doing his best to preserve his
guardian from harm. When Miss MacDonald was telling this
particular part of the adventure to some ladies that were
paying their respects to her on board the <em>Bridgewater</em> in Leith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Road, some of them with raptures cried out: 'O Miss, what a
happy creature are you who had that dear Prince to lull you
asleep, and to take such care of you with his hands spread
about your head, when you was sleeping! You are surely the
happiest woman in the world!' 'I could,' says one of them,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
'wipe your shoes with pleasure, and think it my honour so to
do, when I reflect that you had the honour to have the Prince
for your handmaid. We all envy you greatly.' Much about
the same time a lady of rank and dignity,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> being on board
with Miss MacDonald in the foresaid ship, a brisk gale began
to blow and make the sea rough, and not so easy for a small
boat to row to Leith. The lady whispered to Miss MacDonald
that she would with pleasure stay on board all night that she
might have it to say that she had the honour of lying in the
same bed with that person who had been so happy as to be
[<em>fol.</em> 197.]
guardian to her Prince. Accordingly they did sleep in one
bed that night. Several ladies<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> made valuable presents to
Miss MacDonald, viz., gowns, skirts, headsutes, shoes, stockings,
etc., etc. Commodore Smith made her a present when she was
in Leith Road of a handsome sute of riding-cloaths, with plain
mounting, and some fine linen for riding shirts, as also a gown
to her woman (Kate MacDonal) and some linen to be shirts
for poor Kate, who could not talk one word of English, being
a native of Sky, and who generously offered herself to Miss
MacDonald when she could get not one that would venture to
go with her.</p>

<p>The Prince gave to Miss MacDonald the garters he wore
with the woman's cloaths, which were French, of blue velvet
covered upon one side with white silk, and fastened with
buckles. Miss MacDonald's brother (son of honest Armadale)
coming south to find a passage for Holland, where he was to
enter into the Dutch service, brought these garters along with
him, and deposited them in the hands of a friend<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> in Leith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to be kept for his sister till she should be so happy as to
return from London. He said his sister had writ from the
Road of Leith to Sky concerning the garters, intreating they
might be carefully preserved, for that she put a great value
upon them.</p>

<p>When Miss MacDonald was a prisoner she happened in
coursing about from place to place to fall in luckily with
[<em>fol.</em> 198.]
Captain O'Neil, then a prisoner likewise, to whom she made
up, and giving him a gentle slap upon the cheek with the loof
of her hand, said, 'To that black face do I owe all my misfortune.'
The captain with a smile replied, 'Why, Madam,
what you call your misfortune is truly your greatest honour.
And if you be careful to demean yourself agreeably to the
character you have already acquired, you will in the event find
it to be your happiness.' She told him she was much afraid
they designed to carry her to London, which she could not
think of but with the utmost uneasiness, not knowing what
might turn out to be the consequence. Upon this O'Neil told
her that he would take upon him to commence prophet in the
case, and to foretell what would happen to her. 'For,' said
he, 'if you are carried to London I can venture to assure you
it will be for your interest and happiness; and instead of
being afraid of this you ought to wish for it. There you will
meet with much respect and very good and great friends for
what you have done. Only be careful to make all your conduct
of a piece. Be not frighten'd by the thoughts of your present
circumstances either to say or do anything that may in the
[<em>fol.</em> 199.]
least tend to contradict or sully the character you are now<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
mistress of, and which you can never be robbed of but by
yourself. Never once pretend (through an ill-judg'd excess of
caution and prudence) to repent or be ashamed of what you
have done, and I dare take upon me to answer for the rest. I
do not think (added he) that the Government can be so very
barbarous and cruel as to bring you to a trial for your life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
therefore I hope you have nothing to fear, and that things
will happen to you as I have said.'</p>

<p>Captain O'Neil was wont to tell those who visited him in the
Castle of Edinburgh that he had been at the same pains as a
parent would be with a child to lay down rules to Miss
MacDonald for her future behaviour under the misfortune of
being a prisoner, and that it gave him infinite pleasure to find
that things had happened to her hitherto according to his
words, and to hear by all the accounts he could learn that she
had sacredly observed the advices he had given her. He frequently
expressed his heartiest wishes that she might get free
of all her troubles, and arrive at that which so justly she
deserved.</p>

<p>When Miss MacDonald was on board the <em>Bridgewater</em> in
Leith Road, accounts had come that the Prince was taken
prisoner, and one of the officers had brought the news of this
report on board. She got an opportunity of talking privately
to some who were then visiting her, and said with tears in her
eyes, 'Alas, I am afraid that now all is in vain that I have
[<em>fol.</em> 200.]
done. The Prince at last is in the hands of his enemies.'
Though at that time great fear was entertained about the truth
of this account, yet those that were with Miss MacDonald
endeavoured all they could to chear her up, and to dissuade her
from believing any such thing. But still fears haunted her
mind till the matter was cleared up and the contrary appeared.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald is Protestant, and is descended of the family
of Clanranald by her father, and of an Episcopal clergyman
by her mother. She is daughter of the deceast Ranald
MacDonald of Milton in South Uist, in which island (when the
Prince was skulking thereabouts) she happened to be visiting
her brother-german who had a little before taken up house at
Milton. She was not many days there till she was engaged
in the hazardous enterprize; and when she returned to her
mother in Sky, the honest old woman was surprized to see her,
and asked the reason why she had made such a short stay with
her brother. Miss replied that things being in a hurry and
confusion in South Uist, with such a number of military folks,
she was uneasy till she got out of it; but she never once
hinted at the adventure she had so successfully managed, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
which the mother knew nothing at all till a party came to
take the daughter prisoner, although Miss had been with her
[<em>fol.</em> 201.]
mother eight or ten days before she was seized. Immediately
Miss Flora was hurried on board of a sloop of war without
being allowed the priviledge of taking leave of her mother, or
telling her anything of the matter, or taking along with herself
one stitch to change another. The sloop called the <em>Greyhound</em>,
or rather the <em>Furnace</em>, was commanded by John
Ferguson of Aberdeenshire,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> a man remarkably rigid and
severe in his way, but one of too much greedy sense to have
butchered the Prince if he had fallen into his hands. For
when he was asked by a friend of his own<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> in Edinburgh what
he would have done with the Prince had he got him into his
clutches, whether or not he would have dispatched him, he
answered, 'No (by G&mdash;&mdash;), I would have been so far from
doing any such thing that I would have preserved him as the
apple of mine eye, for I would not take any man's word, no,
not the Duke of Cumberland's for £30,000 Sterling, though I
knew many to be such fools as to do it.' Ferguson was more
[<em>fol.</em> 202.]
than once (as he thought) within an hour of catching the
Prince, so closely he pursued the royal wanderer, and such an
anxiety he had to touch the price of blood.</p>

<p>It was Miss MacDonald's good fortune to be soon removed
out of the hands of Ferguson into those of the polite and
generous Commodore Smith, who, in the coursing about,
obtained leave of General Campbell to allow Miss to go ashore
to visit her mother and to seek a servant to attend her in the
state of confinement. Then it was that poor Kate MacDonal
generously made an offer to run all risques with the captive
lady, who gladly accepted.</p>

<p>One day in the Road of Leith a lady<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> asking Miss if she
had any books on board, she said she had only a prayer book,
but regreted much the want of a bible, which that lady soon
furnished her with in a present in two pretty pocket volumes,
handsomely bound. That she might have some innocent and
useful employment for her time, care was taken by a lady<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
send her a thimble, needles, white thread of different sorts,
etc., with some linen and cambrick cut and shaped according
[<em>fol.</em> 203.]
to the newest fashions. This piece of friendship Miss Flora
admired as much as any instance of kindness and regard that
had been shown her, because all the time she had been in
custody she was quite idle, having no work to do, and thereby
time pass'd very dully on.</p>

<p>While she was in the Road of Leith, from the beginning of
September to the 7th of November, she never was allowed to
set her foot once on shore, though in other respects the officers
were extremely civil and complaisant to her, and took it
exceedingly well when any persons came to visit her. Sometimes
they were so obliging as to come ashore for good company
to attend her, and frequently declared that if they knew
any person to come on board out of curiosity and not out of
respect for Miss MacDonald, that person should not have
access to her. This genteel behaviour makes it to be presumed
that their orders were so exceedingly strict that they could
not dare to bring her ashore. Commodore Smith (Commander
of the <em>Eltham</em>) behaved like a father to her, and tendered her
many good advices as to her behaviour in her ticklish situation;
and Captain Knowler of the <em>Bridgewater</em> used her with
the utmost decency and politeness. When company came to
visit her she was indulged the privilege by both these humane
and well-bred gentlemen to call for anything on board as if
[<em>fol.</em> 204.]
she had been at her own fireside, and the servants of the cabin
were obliged to give her all manner of attendance; and she
had the liberty to invite any of her friends to dine with her
when she pleased. Her behaviour in company was so easy,
modest, and well-adjusted that every visitant was much surprized;
for she had never been out of the islands of South
Uist and Sky till about a year before the Prince's arrival that
she had been in the family of MacDonald of Largie in Argyllshire
for the space of ten or eleven months; and during her
confinement she had been all along on board a ship of war till
she went to London.</p>

<p>Some that went on board to pay their respects to her, used
to take a dance in the cabin, and to press her much to share
with them in the diversion. But with all their importunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
they could not prevail with her to take a trip. She told them
that at present her dancing days were done, and she would not
readily entertain a thought of that diversion till she should be
assured of her Prince's safety, and perhaps not till she should
be bless'd with the happiness of seeing him again. Although
she was easy and chearful, yet she had a certain mixture of
gravity in all her behaviour which became her situation
exceedingly well, and set her of to great advantage. She is
[<em>fol.</em> 205.]
of a low stature, of a fair complexion and well enough shap'd.
One could not discern by her conversation that she had spent
all her former days in the Highlands; for she talks English (or
rather Scots) easily, and not at all through the Earse tone. She
has a sweet voice and sings well; and no lady, Edinburgh bred,
can acquit herself better at the tea-table than what she did
when in Leith Road. Her wise conduct in one of the most
perplexing scenes that can happen in life, her fortitude and
good sense, are memorable instances of the strength of a female
mind, even in those years that are tender and unexperienced.
She is the delight of her friends and the envy of her enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746
29 June</div>

<p>When the Prince came to Kingsburgh's house (Sunday,
June 29th) it was between ten and eleven at night; and Mrs.
MacDonald, not expecting to see her husband that night was
making ready to go to bed. One of her servant maids came
and told her that Kingsburgh was come home and had brought
some company with him. 'What company?' says Mrs. MacDonald.
'Milton's daughter, I believe,' says the maid, 'and
some company with her.' 'Milton's daughter,' replies Mrs.
MacDonald, 'is very welcome to come here with any company
[<em>fol.</em> 206]
she pleases to bring. But you'll give my service to her, and
tell her to make free with anything in the house; for I am
very sleepy and cannot see her this night.' In a little her own
daughter came and told her in a surprize, 'O mother, my
father has brought in a very odd, muckle, ill-shaken-up wife as
ever I saw! I never saw the like of her, and he has gone into
the hall with her.' She had scarce done with telling her tale
when Kingsburgh came and desired his lady to fasten on her
bucklings again, and to get some supper for him and the company
he had brought with him. 'Pray, goodman,' says she,
'what company is this you have brought with you?' 'Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
goodwife,' said he, 'you shall know that in due time; only
make haste and get some supper in the meantime.' Mrs. MacDonald
desired her daughter to go and fetch her the keys she
had left in the hall. When the daughter came to the door of
the hall, she started back, ran to her mother and told her she
could not go in for the keys, for the muckle woman was walking
up and down in the hall, and she was so frighted at seeing
her that she could not have the courage to enter. Mrs. MacDonald
went herself to get the keys, and I heard her more
than once declare that upon looking in at the door she had
[<em>fol.</em> 207.]
not the courage to go forward. 'For,' said she, 'I saw such
an odd muckle trallup of a carlin, making lang wide steps
through the hall that I could not like her appearance at all.'
Mrs. MacDonald called Kingsburgh, and very seriously begged
to know what a lang, odd hussie was this he had brought to
the house; for that she was so frighted at the sight of her
that she could not go into the hall for her keys. 'Did you
never see a woman before,' said he, 'goodwife? What frights
you at seeing a woman? Pray, make haste, and get us some
supper.' Kingsburgh would not go for the keys, and therefore
his lady behov'd to go for them. When she entered the hall,
the Prince happen'd to be sitting; but immediately he arose,
went forward and saluted Mrs. MacDonald, who, feeling a long
stiff beard, trembled to think that this behoved to be some
distressed nobleman or gentleman in disguise, for she never
dream'd it to be the Prince, though all along she had been
seized with a dread she could not account for from the moment
she had heard that Kingsburgh had brought company with
him. She very soon made out of the hall with her keys, never
saying one word. Immediately she importun'd Kingsburgh to
tell her who the person was, for that she was sure by the salute
that it was some distressed gentleman. Kingsburgh smiled at
[<em>fol.</em> 208.]
the mention of the bearded kiss, and said: 'Why, my dear, it
is the Prince. You have the honour to have him in your
house.' 'The Prince,' cried she. 'O Lord, we are a' ruin'd
and undone for ever! We will a' be hang'd now!' 'Hout,
goodwife,' says the honest stout soul, 'we will die but ance;
and if we are hanged for this, I am sure we die in a good
cause. Pray, make no delay; go, get some supper. Fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
what is readiest. You have eggs and butter and cheese in the
house, get them as quickly as possible.' 'Eggs and butter
and cheese!' says Mrs. MacDonald, 'what a supper is that
for a Prince?' 'O goodwife,' said he, 'little do you know
how this good Prince has been living for some time past.
These, I can assure you, will be a feast to him. Besides, it
would be unwise to be dressing a formal supper, because this
would serve to raise the curiosity of the servants, and they
would be making their observations. The less ceremony and
work the better. Make haste and see that you come to
supper.' 'I come to supper!' says Mrs. MacDonald; 'how can
I come to supper? I know not how to behave before Majesty.'
'You must come,' says Kingsburgh, 'for he will not eat a bit
[<em>fol.</em> 209.]
till he see you at the table; and you will find it no difficult
matter to behave before him, so obliging and easy is he is in
his conversation.'</p>

<p>The Prince ate of our roasted eggs, some collops, plenty of
bread and butter, etc., and (to use the words of Mrs.
MacDonald) 'the deel a drap did he want in's weam of twa
bottles of sma beer. God do him good o't; for, well I wat,
he had my blessing to gae down wi't.' After he had made a
plentiful supper, he called for a dram; and when the bottle of
brandy was brought, he said he would fill the glass for himself;
'for,' said he, 'I have learn'd in my skulking to take a hearty
dram.' He filled up a bumper and drank it off to the happiness
and prosperity of his landlord and landlady. Then taking a
crack'd and broken pipe out of his poutch, wrapt about with
thread, he asked Kingsburgh if he could furnish him with some
tobacco; for that he had learn'd likewise to smoke in his
wanderings. Kingsburgh took from him the broken pipe and
laid it carefully up with the brogs, and gave him a new clean
pipe and plenty of tobacco.</p>

<p>The Prince and Kingsburgh turn'd very familiar and merry
together, and when the Prince spoke to Kingsburgh, he for the
[<em>fol.</em> 210.]
most part laid his hand upon Kingsburgh's knee and used
several kind and obliging expressions in his conversation with
the happy landlord. Kingsburgh remarked what a lucky thing it
was that he happened to be at Mougstot (Sir Alexander
MacDonald's house), and that it was all a matter of chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that he was there, for he had no design of being there that day.
And then he asked the Prince what he would have done if he
had not been at Mougstot. The Prince replied, 'Why, sir,
you could not avoid being at Mougstot this day; for Providence
ordered you to be there upon my account.' Kingsburgh
became so merry and jocose that putting up his hand to the
Prince's face, he turned off his head-dress which was a very odd
clout of a mutch or toy; upon which Mrs. MacDonald hasted
out of the room and brought a clean nightcap for him.</p>

<p>Both Kingsburgh and his lady said that the Prince's face
and hands were very much sun-burnt. But they declared he
had not a spot of the itch upon him, though a silly report had
been raised by his malicious enemies that he was scabbed to
the eye-holes. His legs, they said, were hacked in some parts,
which was occasioned by his walking and sleeping so often in
[<em>fol.</em> 211.]
wet hose. Mrs. MacDonald used the freedom to put up the
sleeve of his gown and of his shirt (a very coarse dud), 'and
there,' said she, 'I saw a bonny, clean, white skin indeed. The
deel a lady in a' the land has a whiter and purer skin than
he has.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">30 June</div>

<p>Next morning Mrs. MacDonald went to Miss Flora's bedside
before she got up and asked of her an account of the adventure.
Miss (among other things) told her that there was not any
other probable way of saving the Prince but that single one
which had been used, and that it had the appearance of a
desperate attempt at best: that Lady Clanronald provided
them with women's cloathes for the disguise, and that she had
contributed all in her power for preserving the Prince out of
the hands of his enemies. Mrs. MacDonald desired to know
what was become of the boat and the rowers. 'They returned
directly,' said Miss Flora, 'to South Uist.' Mrs. MacDonald
declared great concern to hear that, because upon their return
they would immediately be seized by the military and harshly
used to tell what they knew. 'I wish,' said Mrs. MacDonald,
'you had sunk the boat and kept the boatmen in Sky where
they could have been concealed, and then we would have known
[<em>fol.</em> 212.]
the better what to have done with the Prince, because his
enemies by this means would have lost scent of him. But all
will be wrong by their returning to South Uist.' 'I hope not,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
said Miss, 'for we took care to depone them before they parted
from us.' 'Alas!' replied Mrs. MacDonald, 'your deponing
of them will not signifie a farthing. For if once the military
get hold of them they will terrifie them out of their senses and
make them forget their oath.'</p>

<p>As Mrs. MacDonald said, so it happened. The boatmen
were made prisoners instantly upon their landing in South Uist
and threatened with tortures if they did not declare everything
they knew, which (to avoid pain, and perhaps death itself) they
complied with. From their declaration no doubt it happen'd
that his enemies could specifie the particular parts of the dress
the Prince was disguised in, even to the nicety of telling the
colour of the gown.</p>

<p>After Miss Flora had got up, Mrs. MacDonald told her that
she wanted much to have a lock of the Prince's hair, and that
she behoved to go into his room and get it for her. Miss Flora
refused to do as she desired, because the Prince was not
yet out of bed. 'What then,' said Mrs. MacDonald, 'no
harm will happen to you. He is too good to harm you or any
[<em>fol.</em> 213.]
person. You must instantly go in and get me the lock.' Mrs.
MacDonald, taking hold of Miss with one hand, knocked at
the door of the room with the other. The Prince called, 'Who
is there?' Mrs. MacDonald, opening the door, said, 'Sir, it is
I, and I am importuneing Miss Flora to come in and get a lock
of your hair to me, and she refuses to do it.' 'Pray,' said the
Prince, 'desire Miss MacDonald to come in. What should
make her afraid to come where I am?' When Miss came in
he begged her to sit down on a chair at the bedside, then
laying his arms about her waist, and his head upon her lap, he
desired her to cut out the lock with her own hands in token of
future and more substantial favours. The one half of the lock
Miss gave to Mrs. MacDonald and the other she kept to herself.
I heard Mrs. MacDonald say that when Miss Flora at any time
happened to come into the room where the Prince was, he
always rose from his seat, paid her the same respects as if she
had been a queen, and made her sit on his right hand.</p>

<p>Kingsburgh visited the Prince before he got out of bed and
asked how he had rested all night. 'Never better,' replied he,
[<em>fol.</em> 214.]
'for I have rested exceedingly well, having slept, I believe, nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
or ten hours without interruption.' Then it was that the
conversation happened about Lord George Murray and the
landing of the French, etc.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>When the Prince had got himself dress'd in the Highland
cloaths at the side of the wood, he embraced Kingsburgh in
his arms and bad him a long and a happy adieu, most affectionately
thanking him for all his services, and assuring him he
would never forget them. Then the Prince wept, and some
drops of blood fell from his nose. Kingsburgh could not
refrain from weeping too, and when he saw the blood, expressed
his concern, dreading the Prince not to be in health with the
fatigues, fastings, etc., he was obliged to undergo. The Prince
assured him he was in very good health, and that this was no
extraordinary thing with him at all. 'This,' said he, 'is only
the effect of parting with a dear friend, and ordinarily it
happens to me in such a case. Alas! Kingsburgh, I am afraid
I shall not meet with another MacDonald in my difficulties.'<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
When Kingsburgh returned to his own house he told his lady
that after the Prince had got on the Highland dress and the
claymore in his hand he was a soger-like man indeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 July</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 215.] I heard Mrs. MacDonald of Kingsburgh say that she had the
following particular from Malcolm MacLeod's own mouth before
he was made prisoner. Malcolm went with the Prince and
MacKinnon to the shore to see them fairly boated for the
continent. When he was about to take leave of the Prince he
spied some ships coming in sight and hovering about the coast.
He intreated the Prince not to go on board for some time, but
to wait till he should see how these ships steer'd their course;
'For just now,' said he, 'the wind blows so as to fetch them
this way and to hinder your passing to the continent.' The
Prince replied, 'Never fear, MacLeod, I'll go on board directly.
The wind will change immediately and make these ships steer
a contrary course. Providence will take care of me, and it will
not be in the power of these ships to look near me at this time.'
Malcolm MacLeod declared that the Prince's words made him
astonished and determin'd him to sit down upon the shore to
see what would happen. He said the Prince and his small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
retinue had not rowed many yards from the shore till the wind
changed to a point directly opposite to what it had been, and
[<em>fol.</em> 216.]
blowing pretty briskly made the ships steer so as to be soon
out of sight. Mr. MacLeod affirm'd that in all the course of
his life he had never known any man that had such a firm trust
and well-grounded confidence as the Prince was remarkably
endued with.</p>

<p>Captain John Ferguson searched Sir Alexander MacDonald's
house for the Prince, and in quest of him he came to Kingsburgh,
where he examined Kingsburgh and his lady and their
daughter, Miss Nanie MacDonald, <em>alias</em> Mrs. MacAllaster, for
she is married. Kingsburgh told his lady that Captain
Ferguson was come to examine her about some lodgers she had
lately in her house, and desired her to be distinct in her
answers. Mrs. MacDonald looking Ferguson broad in the face
said, 'If Captain Ferguson is to be my judge, then God have
mercy upon my soul.' Ferguson asked for what reason she
spoke such words. 'Why, Sir,' said she, 'the world belies you
if you be not a very cruel, hard-hearted man; and indeed I do
not like to come through your hands.' Ferguson had nothing
else to say for himself but the common saying, viz., That people
should not believe all that the world says.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 July</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 217.] When Ferguson asked Kingsburgh where Miss MacDonald
and the person along with her in woman's cloaths lay all night
in his house, he answered, 'I know in what room Miss
MacDonald herself lay, but where servants are laid when in
my house, I know nothing of that matter, I never enquire
anything about it. My wife is the properest person to inform
you about that.' Then he had the impertinence to ask Mrs.
MacDonald, Whether or not she had laid the young Pretender
and Miss MacDonald in one bed? To which she answered,
'Sir, whom you mean by the young Pretender I shall not
pretend to guess; but I can assure you it is not the fashion in
the Isle of Sky to lay the mistress and the maid in the same
bed together.' Then Ferguson desired to see the different
rooms where their late lodgers had slept; and after seeing them
he said, it was pretty remarkable that the room in which the
maid had slept seem'd to look better than the one where the
mistress had been laid; and this behoved to confirm him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
beief that it was the young Pretender in women's cloaths
who had been along with Miss MacDonald. Kingsburgh's
daughter said it could not be the person he meant in women's
[<em>fol.</em> 218.]
cloaths, for that she had heard that person ask something (a
bottle of water) from Miss MacDonald in Erse. 'This,' says
Ferguson, 'confirms me more and more in my opinion, for I
have often heard that a fellow went to Rome some years agoe
on purpose to teach the young Pretender the Erse language.'
This, by the bye, is a gross mistake in Ferguson; for the
Prince could not speak a word of Erse till he arriv'd in
Scotland, and he knew but very little of it till he was forced to
commence wanderer for the preservation of his life, and then
he learned to speak it pretty well, which prov'd of very great
use to him.</p>

<p>When Kingsburgh and Miss MacDonald were made prisoners
and brought before General Campbell (which happened at
different times) both of them honestly own'd the parts they
had acted, and, if I rightly remember, declarations were written
from their own mouths and they subscribed them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Miss Flora MacDonald called her disguised handmaid
Bettie Bourk, or Burk, an Irish name, and made the dress of a
piece with the proposed character, being a hood with a long
mantle almost down to the heel.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">August

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 219.] <span class="smcap">Lord George Sackville</span> with a command of 400 men was
ordered from Fort Augustus to gather up the gleanings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
cattle that might happen to be left in the countries that had
been plundered and pillaged. When he was at Locharkaig the
Prince and his small retinue had been thirty or forty hours
without any meat. One evening they spied Lord George and
his command driving away the cattle they had pick'd up here
and there. They were then consulting with one another what
was fittest to be done to procure themselves some provisions in
this extremity, and it was proposed that they should go to a
place at the distance of sixteen miles from them. The Prince
objected against this measure alleging that the journey was too
long for them in their present distressed condition, and that
perhaps they might be disappointed of their intention when
they should come to the place spoken of. 'What would ye
think, gentlemen,' said he, 'of lifting some of the cattle we
[<em>fol.</em> 220.]
spied under a command this evening? They are not far from
us, and I hope we will succeed in the design, for the gloom of
the night will favour us in the attempt.' His companions
looked upon the enterprize as too hazardous, and could not
think at all of running such a risque. But the Prince still
insisted upon it as the best expedient they could pitch upon
in the present difficulty, and said, 'If the dangers attending
this expedition be all that can be said against it, I myself will
be one of the number that will made the attempt.' Upon this
four of the company declared they would gladly go along with
him and try what they could do. Away they went, and (as
the Prince had suggested) by the favour of the dark night they
brought off six cows without being in the least discovered&mdash;a
most lucky and plentiful supply in such necessitous circumstances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Though Glenevis had never join'd the Prince, but
had lived peaceably at home, and though no overt act could
be proved against him, yet his conduct could not screen him
from cruel treatment. All his effects were plundered and
pillaged, his houses burnt down to the ground, and he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
suffered imprisonment for eleven or twelve months, and was
[<em>fol.</em> 221.]
not released till by a petition presented before the lords of
justiciary he pled the benefit of the indemnity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Among the several remarkable and lesser circumstances
of Kingsburgh's history I have forgot to mention some
which are well worth remarking, and are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>When Kingsburgh came to Fort Augustus he was immediately
ordered into the provo's guard, where the common
fellows took the buckles out of his shoes, the garters from his
legs, and his watch and money out of his pockets, a ceremony,
it seems, preparatory to one's being taken out to be hang'd;
at least Kingsburgh looked upon it as such. 'For,' said he,
'I expected every moment to be ordered out to end my life
on a gibbet, and I laid my account with it.' After staying
there for some hours he was then ordered to be thrown into a
dungeon with heavy irons upon him, which he looked upon as
a change to the better by reason of the insults, the opprobrious
and blasphemous language, he behoved to endure from
the common fellows.</p>

<p>When Kingsburgh was removed from Fort Augustus he was
brought to Edinburgh under a guard of Kingston's Light horse,
who entered the city with sound of trumpet and beat of kettle-drums,
a circumstance very much noticed by everybody as a
[<em>fol.</em> 222.]
form of procession quite unusual for the bringing a prisoner
into a metropolis. The command halted a considerable time
upon the street of Edinburgh till further orders should be
got, when the mob came flocking about them, and some of
them said, 'What can be the matter with this honest-like,
well-looking man that he is brought here a prisoner? Show
your face, honest man, to the world, for, faith, you may be seen
as well as the best of them all.' Then Kingsburgh was put
into the same room of the Castle with Major MacDonell,
George Moir, the Laird of Leckie, Mr. Thomas Ogilvie, etc.,
where he thought himself very happy indeed; but that
happiness did not last long.</p>

<p>One day when I was visiting him and his fellow-prisoners,
one of them happened to be complaining of the hardships of
their situation, saying, 'Is not this a dull and uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
state to be pacing up and down this room, waiting the freak
and humour of an officer to let us out when he thinks fit to
walk for an hour or so within the narrow bounds of the Half-moon?'
Kingsburgh gently check'd him for his complaining,
and said, 'Do not complain, Sir, for there are many situations
far worse than ours. Had you been only in my condition at
Fort Augustus you would have experienc'd a very great odds.
[<em>fol.</em> 223.]
When I was taken out of the provo's guard and put into the
dungeon with irons upon me, I thought myself happy; but
when I was removed to a room and the irons taken off me,
though I was not allowed to step over the threshold, I thought
myself in a kind of paradise. And now that I am here and in
exceeding good company (a happiness I had not before) I think
myself still more and more in a paradise. I am really content.
I am quite satisfied with my condition, if they will only allow
me to stay with this good company. And what do you think,
Sir, of the liberty of walking upon the Half-moon, tho' it were
but for an hour or two at a time? I do assure you this is no
small happiness in a state of confinement. What would I have
given for such a liberty at Fort Augustus?' Kingsburgh was
not allowed to make a long abode with his agreeable companions,
for he was soon removed to a room by himself under a strict
and close confinement, not having the liberty to step over the
threshold of his door, and no person being allowed to come
near him but the officer upon guard, the serjeant, and the
keeper that was appointed to attend him as a servant.</p>

<p>When his lady came to Edinburgh she was not allowed access
[<em>fol.</em> 224.]
to him, but only to stand upon the parade and see her husband
looking down to her through the grate of a window, the officers
and sogers witnessing their enquiring about ane another's
welfare. At last Kingsburgh fell so ill in his health that a
physician and surgeon behoved to have access to him, but
always in presence of an officer. Then his lady after many and
earnest solicitations obtained the privilege of being with him
throughout the day, but was obliged to leave him upon the
approach of the evening. When he was recovering he was
allowed to step out, only once or twice a week, with an officer
attending him, to take a walk in the garden or any other
by-place of the Castle, not being indulged the pleasure of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the other prisoners or of walking on the same spot with them;
till some short time before his releasement that he was permitted
now and then to be on the Half-moon with them. All
the reason that ever could be discovered for this severity and
strictness upon Kingsburgh was this. When he was in the
same room with Major MacDonell, Leckie, etc., many persons
came to pay their respects to him, and to hear his story, which
he very plainly and honestly gave, at the same time never
[<em>fol.</em> 225.]
failing to give an exact account of the Prince's adventures and
chearful conduct in the course of his wanderings, as far as he
had got any intelligence about them. This reaching the ears
of those in power it proved not a little disgusting to them to
hear such things as served to form a great and glorious
character of the Prince, and therefore Kingsburgh behoved to
suffer for narrating some stubborn, ill-manner'd truths, and to
feel the effects of being a plain, honest man. Truth, tho' never
so glaring, when it runs cross to the partial notions and
inclinations of poor frail mortals, grates very hard and becomes
a very uneasy and painful thing.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman happening to visit the lady prisoners
upon the same stair where Kingsburgh endured his strict
and close confinement, and spying Kingsburgh's room door
to be open, he made a stop. Upon this the sentry, knowing
the gentleman, whispered to him that as the keeper
was employed in bringing some things to Kingsburgh the
door would be open for some short time, and that he
would allow him to step in and ask Kingsburgh about his
welfare, provided that he would not sit down, but come
[<em>fol</em>. 226.] as quickly as possible. Accordingly the gentleman went
in and embracing Kingsburgh regreted this change in his
condition. Kingsburgh smiled, and said, 'The Government
little knows what pleasure this treatment gives me; for
they are doing me much honour without designing it. They
are at much pains to make me a considerable person. Little
did I ever think that I was a man of such consequence that a
whole Government should be so much taken up about me. If
I am so lucky as to keep my health, this change shall give me
no uneasiness.' Then he desired the gentleman to inform his
companions in the other room that he was in very good health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and that he kept up his heart in his solitary state, and to
forbid them to be any way uneasy about his solitary condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29 June</div>

<p>When the Prince was in Kingsburgh's house talking about
the difficulties and dangers attending his situation, and consulting
with him what might be the best and fittest expedient for
the safety of his person, he suggested going to the Laird of MacLeod's
house as by far the properest place that could be pitched
upon, because it was not liable to any suspicion or jealousy
[<em>fol.</em> 227.]
upon the part of the Government, and therefore would not be
searched for him. If he could only get there without discovery,
he said, he thought he would be in absolute safety.
Kingsburgh told him that he would not take upon him positively
to oppose any measure the Prince was pleased to condescend
upon for the preservation of his own person; but
then, if his opinion could be of any use in the present case, he
behoved to declare that he should never have his advice or
approbation for going to the Laird of MacLeod's house at any
rate.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The Prince in a surprize clapped his hand to his breast
and said, 'What! Kingsburgh! Do you think that MacLeod
to his other doings would add that of thirsting after my
blood? Do you really think he would go the length of giving
me up into the hands of my enemies?' Kingsburgh would
not pretend to assign particular reasons for its not being
advisable that the Prince should go to MacLeod's house; but
still he assured him, it should never be with his consent. The
Prince insisted no more upon this project, and dropt it altogether.
This I had from Kingsburgh's own mouth, and his
narrating of it consists with the knowledge of several others,
particularly his fellow-prisoners.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 228.] By appointment the said Captain Malcolm MacLeod and
Murdoch MacLeod, Raaza's third son, met the Prince at Pourttree,
a publick house in the isle of Sky, upon Monday's night,
June 30th, 1746. After taking leave of Kingsburgh at the
side of a wood, the Prince<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> had set out directly for this place,
where Miss Flora MacDonald (taking a different road) met
him once more and bad farewel to him. Captain Malcolm
MacLeod said he would not positively affirm whether it was
Monday's night or Tuesday's morning when they met; 'But,'
said he, 'it was dark.' Raaza's third son had been in the
Prince's service, and had received a musket-shot through his
shoulder at the battle of Culloden.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1 July</div>

<p>Before these two gentlemen had set out from the island of
Raaza in order to meet the Prince at Pourttree, the young
[<em>fol.</em> 229.]
Laird of Raaza, John MacLeod, came to the Captain and told
him what a great anxiety he had to see that young man, the
Prince. Malcolm MacLeod begged him to consider well what
he was doing, that as he had not been out, he ought to run no
risque for satisfying his desire, which at present could be of
no real use or service, and therefore he suggested to him to
act in this affair with the utmost prudence and caution.
Meantime Malcolm could not help owning frankly that he
himself heartily wished that his friend might see the Prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
provided he could do it with safety. But then he would leave
it altogether to himself to determine on which side he should
think fit to chuse. After thinking a while, young Raaza positively
declared he was resolved to see the Prince if it should
cost him the estate and the head, and accordingly accompanied
his brother and the Captain to Pourttree<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in a small boat
that would contain only six or seven men with difficulty.
Upon meeting with the Prince they spent very little time at
Pourttree, but attended him soon to the same small boat; and
the Captain did not introduce young Raaza to the Prince till
they were in the boat.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Early in the morning, July 1st, they
arrived at Glam, in Raaza, where they remained two days in a
mean, low hut; and young Raaza was the person that brought
provisions to them, viz., a lamb and a kid in the nook of his
plaid.</p>

<p>At that time there happened to be in Raaza a fellow who had
come into the island upon pretence of selling a roll of tobacco;
[<em>fol.</em> 230.]
but after he had sold off his tobacco he continued strolling up
and down the island in an idle way without anything to do,
for no less than twelve or fourteen days, which made the
people of the island suspect him to be a spy. When the
Prince and his friends were in the hut, Malcolm MacLeod
happened to see this stroller coming towards the hut, which
he took notice of to the Prince, and told him withal what
kind of a fellow he was suspected to be. The Prince not
liking the thing so well, Malcolm said he should take care
that the fellow should not go back again, for that he would
immediately go out and shoot him through the head. 'O,
no,' said the Prince, 'God forbid that any poor man should
suffer for us, if we can but keep ourselves anyway safe.' And
he would not allow the Captain to stir, though their apprehensions
behov'd to be the greater that the hut was not upon
any road. But the fellow happened to pass by it without
looking into it.</p>

<p>The Prince began to be anxious to be out of Raaza, alleging
the island to be too narrow and confin'd in its bounds for
his purpose, and proposed setting out for Troternish in Sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
But his companions told him that they thought him in safety
where he was, and did not like that he should change his place
so soon. The Prince pressed so much for going to the place
he had mentioned, pretending he had a tryst there with a
[<em>fol.</em> 231.]
gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> which he would not break for any thing, that his
friends yielded to his importunity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2 July</div>

<p>July 2d. About 7 o'clock at night he went on board the
above mentioned small boat, attended by the young Laird of
Raaza (who could not think of parting from him soon) and
his brother Murdoch, Captain MacLeod and the two boatmen,
John MacKenzie and Donald MacFrier, who had been both
out in his service, the one a sergeant and the other a private
man. They had not well left the shore till the wind blew a
hard gale, and the sea became so very rough and tempestuous
that all on board begged he would return; for the waves were
beating over and over them, the men tugging hard at the
oars, and Captain MacLeod laving the water out of the little
boat. The Prince would by no means hear of returning, and
to divert the men from thinking on the danger he sung them
a merry Highland song. About nine or ten o'clock the same
night they landed at a place in Sky called Nicolson's Rock,
near Scorobreck, in Troternish. In rowing along they found
the coast very bad and dangerous, and when they came to the
Rock the Prince was the third man that jump'd out among
the water and cried out, 'Take care of the boat, and hawl her
up to dry ground,' which was immediately done, he himself
assisting as much as any one of them.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The Prince had upon
him a large big coat, which was become very heavy and
[<em>fol.</em> 232.]
cumbersome by the waves beating so much upon it, for it was
wet through and through. Captain MacLeod proposed taking
the big coat to carry it, for the rock was steep and of a very
uneasy ascent. But the Prince would not part with the coat,
wet as it was, alleging he was as able to carry it as the Captain
was.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> They went forwards to a cow-byre on the rock, about
two miles from Scorobreck, a gentleman's house. In this byre
the Prince took up his quarters, the whole company still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
attending him. Here they took some little refreshment of
bread and cheese they had along with them, the cakes being
mouldered down into very small crumbs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3 July</div>

<p>Captain MacLeod intreated the Prince to put on a dry shirt
and to take some sleep; but he continued sitting in his wet
cloaths, and did not then incline to sleep. However, at last
he began to nap a little, and would frequently start in his
sleep, look briskly up, and stare boldly in the face of every one
of them as if he had been to fight them. Upon his waking he
would sometimes cry out, 'O Poor England! O Poor England!'
The Prince desired the Captain to take some rest, but he did
not chuse to sleep at that time. However, when the Prince
began to importune him, the Captain thought perhaps the
[<em>fol.</em> 233.]
Prince wants a private opportunity to say something to Raaza's
son, and therefore he stept aside a little. The two brothers<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
and the boatmen parted from the Prince at the byre. He
promised to meet the youngest brother again at Camistinawagg,
another place in the same island.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The Prince said he expected Donald MacDonald <em>alias</em>
Donald Roy to come to him; but he not coming, the Prince
asked Captain MacLeod if he was a stout walker? and if he
could walk bare-footed? The Captain replied he was pretty
good at walking, and that he could travell bare-footed very
well. The Prince told him by bare-footed he meant, if he
could walk in his shoes without stockings, 'for,' said he, 'that
is the way I used to walk at my diversions in Italy.' The
Captain said he could not really tell if he could do that or not,
for that he had never tried it.</p>

<p>About six or seven o'clock at night the Prince, taking the little
baggage in his hand, stept out of the byre, and desired the
Captain to follow him. The Captain came up to him and
said, 'Give me that,' taking hold of the little baggage, which
he gave him, and then the Captain followed him without
speaking one word till they were out of sight of the cow-byre,
when the Prince happening to turn such a way as the Captain
[<em>fol.</em> 234.]
did not think so safe, he made up to him and said: 'Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
royal highness will pardon me to ask where you are going, for
that I dread you may chance to fall into the hands of some
party or another, if you do not take exceeding good care, as
there are many small parties dispersed up and down the
country.' The Prince then said: 'Why, MacLeod, I now
throw myself entirely into your hands, and leave you to do
with me what you please. Only I want to go to Strath, MacKinnon's
country. I hope you will accompany me, an you
think you can lead me safe enough into Strath.' The Captain
declared he would go with him where he pleased, and said he
could undertake to bring him into MacKinnon's country safe
enough, provided he would go by sea, which he might easily
do, for that he really did not think it so safe for him to go by
land by reason of the several parties that were searching the
country. The Prince said he would go by land, for that there
was no doing anything in their situation without running
risques, and proposed directing their course immediately for
the place intended, alleging that he himself knew the way very
well. 'I am sure,' says the Captain, 'I must know it much
[<em>fol.</em> 235.]
better, and I must tell you that we have a long journey to
make, no less than 24 or 30 long miles. For I dare not lead
you the direct road, but take you byways, and go here and
there cross the country to keep as free as we can of the parties
scattered up and down.' Then the Captain hinted that he
thought it not so convenient to set out when night was coming
on lest they should fall into dangers and inconveniences for
want of knowing well where they were. But the Prince insisted
upon setting out immediately; and accordingly away they
went along the ridges of high hills, and through wild muirs
and glens. All the time from first to last of this adventure
the Captain was exceedingly afraid of what might happen, lest
bad things should be imputed to him, in case of any harm
befalling the Prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 July</div>

<p>The Prince proposed to pass for the Captain's servant, the
better to conceal him, which was agreed to, and that he should
be named Lewie Caw,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> there being of that name a young
surgeon lad (who had been in the Prince's service) skulking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that time in Sky, where he had some relations. The Captain
advised the Prince, since he had proposed being his servant, to
walk at some distance behind him; and if at any time he
[<em>fol.</em> 236.]
happened to meet with any persons and to converse with them,
as he was well known in the island, that the Prince should
show no concern at all in his face, but sit down at a small
distance, when he should happen to talk with any folks. The
Prince assured him that no appearance of concern should be
seen about him, and that he should be careful to observe the
proper distance of a servant, and to do the duty of one by
carrying the baggage, which very often he would not part with
to the Captain when he desired it of him, and even pressed to
have it.</p>

<p>The conversation happening to turn upon Lord George
Murray, the Prince said that Lord George Murray (whether
out of ignorance, or with a view to betray him he would not
say) did not behave well at all with respect to obeying of
orders; and that particularly for two or three days before the
battle of Culloden Lord George did scarce any one thing he
desired him to do.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>When the Captain was informing the Prince about the many
cruelties and barbarities committed after Culloden battle, the
Prince was amazed, and said, 'Surely that man who calls himself
the Duke, and pretends to be so great a general, cannot be
guilty of such cruelties, I cannot believe them.'</p>

<p>The Captain, happening to see the Prince uneasy and fidging,
took him to the back of a know, and opening his breast, saw
[<em>fol.</em> 237.]
him troubled with lice for want of clean linen, and by reason
of the coarse odd way he behoved to live in, both as to sustenance
and sleep. He said, he believed, he took fourscore off
him.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> This serves to show that he was reduced to the very
lowest ebb of misery and distress, and is a certain indication of
that greatness of soul which could rise above all misfortunes,
and bear up with a chearfulness, not to be equalled in history,
under all the scenes of woe that could happen. He used to
say that the fatigues and distresses he underwent signified
nothing at all, because he was only a single person; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he reflected upon the many brave fellows who suffered in his
cause, that, he behoved to own, did strike him to the heart,
and did sink very deep with him.</p>

<p>The Prince, even when warm and sweating, used to drink a
great deal of water in his wandering from place to place, and
the Captain was always sure to desire him to take a dram
above the water to qualifie it. The Captain intreated him not
to drink water when he was sweating lest he should thereby
injure his health. 'No, no,' said the Prince, 'that will never
hurt me in the least. If you happen to drink any cold thing
when you are warm, only remember, MacLeod, to piss after
drinking, and it will do you no harm at all. This advice I
had from a friend abroad.' The Captain said the Prince was
always sure to observe this direction.</p>

<p>When the Captain was asked if the Prince was really in good
[<em>fol.</em> 238.]
health when he happened to be with him he said, it was not
possible he could be altogether in good health considering the
many fatigues and distresses he was obliged to undergo, and
that (as he had heard) he had been seized with a bloody flux
before he left South Uist. But then, he said, the Prince would
never own himself to be in any bad state of health at all, and
always bore up with a surprizing stock of spirits. It was never
in the power of any person to discover an appearance of bad
health about him. He walked very quickly, and had a good
appetite.</p>

<p>At last the brandy bottle began to come near the bottom,
when the Prince pressed the Captain to take a dram lest he
should faint with the excessive fatigue. But he refused to take
it, and desired the Prince himself to drink it off. The kind
contest ran so high that the Prince told him: The devil a drop
of it he would drink, and therefore he should make an end of
it. The Captain behoved to empty the bottle, which the
Prince proposed to throw away and to break it. 'No, no,'
said the Captain, 'I will be so far from breaking it that I will
do my best to preserve it as a curious piece. It may come to
drink many a cask of whiskie to me yet.' He then hid the
bottle in the heart of a thick bush of heath, and as he knows
the ground well, he hopes to find it upon his return to Sky, if
the cattle have not trampled it to pieces. He said he hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the bottle would make a figure in Westminster yet. He has
likewise the big coat, which the Prince wore wet and heavy.
[<em>fol.</em> 239.]
He took it to London with him, and gave orders to send it
after him when he set out for Scotland.</p>

<p>As they were marching along and talking of the fatigues the
Prince was obliged to undergoe, he said: 'MacLeod, do you
not think that God Almighty has made this person of mine for
doing some good yet? When I was in Italy, and dining at
the king's table, very often the sweat would have been coming
through my coat with the heat of the climate; and now that I
am in a cold country, of a more piercing and trying climate,
and exposed to different kinds of fatigues, I really find I agree
equally with both. I have had this philibeg on now for some
days, and I find I do as well with it as any the best breeches I
ever put on. I hope in God, MacLeod, to walk the streets of
London with it yet.' Then he remarked that the waistcoat he
had upon him was too fine for a servant, being a scarlet tartan
with a gold twist button, and proposed to the master to change
with him, the better to carry on the disguise, which accordingly
was done, the master's vest not being so fine as the servant's.
When the Prince was making the exchange he said, 'I hope,
MacLeod, to give you a much better vest for this yet.'</p>

<p>The Captain remarked it was proper they should pass the
road that leads to the Laird of MacLeod's country in the night
time for fear of parties spying them; which accordingly they
did by break of day. And the Prince looking about him, and
[<em>fol.</em> 240.]
seeing nothing but hills all around them said, 'I am sure, the
Devil cannot find us out now.'</p>

<p>As they were coming near Strath, MacKinnon's country, the
Captain suggested to the Prince that now he was coming to a
country where he would be known and consequently liable to
be discovered in every corner of it, as MacKinnon and his men
had been out in his service, and therefore some shift behoved
to be faln upon to disguise him more and more still. The
Prince proposed blacking his face with some one thing or
another. But the Captain was against that proposal as what
would serve rather to discover him all at once than to conceal
him. The Prince then pulling off the periwig and putting it
into his pocket took out a dirty white napkin and desired the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Captain to tye that about his head, and to bring it down
upon his eyes and nose. He put the bonnet on above the
napkin and said, 'I think I will now pass well enough for
your servant, and that I am sick with the much fatigue I have
undergone. Look at me, MacLeod, and tell me what you think.
How will it do?' MacLeod told him&mdash;this would not do yet,
for that those who had ever seen him before would still discover
his face for all the disguise he was in. The Prince said,
'This is an odd remarkable face I have got that nothing
[<em>fol.</em> 241.]
can disguise it. I heard Mr. MacLeod declare more than once
that the Prince could do any thing or turn himself into any
shape, but that of dissembling his air.' That he could never
disguise with all the arts he could use. 'There is not a person,'
he said, 'that knows what the air of a noble or great man is,
but upon seeing the Prince in any disguise he could put on
would see something about him that was not ordinary, something
of the stately and the grand.'</p>

<p>They were no sooner come into Strath than they met two of
MacKinnon's men who had been out in the expedition. Immediately
they stared upon the Prince, and with hands lifted
up, wept bitterly to see him in such a pickle. Malcolm begged
them to take care what they were doing and to compose themselves,
for that they might do harm by showing any concern.
He took them back with him so far, and cautioning them not
to take any notice of this meeting, took an oath of them, not
to discover at any rate that they had seen the Prince in disguise
or in that corner of the country, and then dismist them. The
men accordingly proved true to their trust.</p>

<p>When they were near the place the Captain designed to set
up at, he told the Prince that he had a sister that dwelt there
who was married to John MacKinnon, a captain, lately under
[<em>fol.</em> 242.]
the Laird of MacKinnon, and that he judged it advisable to
go to his sister's house, advising the Prince in the meantime to
sit at a little distance from the house till he should enquire at
John MacKinnon or his wife if any party was near the place,
and if he (Malcolm MacLeod) could be safe there; and likewise
telling the Prince that he was still to pass for his servant,
Lewie Caw. Mr. MacLeod accordingly went to the house where
he found his sister, but her husband was not at home. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the usual compliments he told his sister that he had come there
perhaps to pass some little time, provided that no party was
near them, and that he was in safety to stay. She assured
him that no party she knew of was in that corner, and that he
was very welcome, and she hoped he would be in safety enough.
He told her that he had no body along with him but one
Lewie Caw (son of Mr. Caw, surgeon in Crief) who had been
out in the late affair, and consequently in the same condemnation
with himself; and that he was with him as his servant.
Upon this Lewie Caw was called upon to come into the house,
the place being called Ellagol, or Ellighuil, near Kilvory or
Kilmaree (<em>i.e.</em> a chapel, or rather a burying place, dedicate to
the Virgin Mary) in Strath. When Lewie entered the house
with the baggage on his back and the napkin about his head
[<em>fol.</em> 243.]
he took off his bonnet, made a low bow and sat at a distance
from his master. The Captain's sister said there was something
about that lad that she liked unco well, and she could not help
admiring his looks. When meat and drink, viz., bread and
cheese, milk, etc. were set down before the master he said to
his servant that he might come in by and take a share,
for that there were no strangers in the house. The sick
Lewie made it shy and refused to eat with his master,
and alledged he knew better manners. But the master
ordering him to come and take a share he obeyed, still keeping
off the bonnet.</p>

<p>In their way to this place the Prince in the night time
happened to fall into a bogue almost to the top of the thighs
and MacLeod behoved to pull him out by the armpits and
thereby was bogued himself. The Captain desired the servant
lass, who could talk nothing but Erse, to bring some water for
his feet, which she did; and being much fatigued he desired
her to wash his feet and legs. When she was washing them he
said, 'You see that poor sick man there, I hope you'll wash
his feet too. It will be great charity, for he has as much need
as I have.' 'No such thing,' said she, 'although I wash the
master's feet, I am not obliged to wash the servant's. What!
he's but a low countrywoman's son. I will not wash his feet
[<em>fol.</em> 244.]
indeed.' However, with much intreaty Malcolm prevailed
upon the maid to stoop so low as to wash poor Lewie's feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
While she was washing them she happened to use him right
roughly, and the Prince said to Malcolm, 'O MacLeod, if you
would desire the girl not to go so far up.'</p>

<p>Malcolm importuned the Prince to go to bed and take some
rest. The Prince then asked who would keep guard for fear
of an alarm? Malcolm said he would do it himself. The Prince
at last was prevailed upon to throw himself upon a bed, but
would not strip. Malcolm desired his sister to go out, and
sit upon the top of a knowe near the house and keep watch
while he and his servant Lewie should take some sleep, which
she accordingly did.</p>

<p>The Captain hearing that the landlord was coming towards
home went out to meet him. After saluting him he asked if
he saw these ships of war (pointing to them) that were hovering
about upon the coast. Mr. MacKinnon said he saw them
very well. 'What,' said MacLeod, 'if our Prince be on board
one of them?' 'God forbid,' replied MacKinnon, 'I would
[<em>fol.</em> 245.]
not wish that for anything.' 'What!' said Malcolm, 'if we
had him here, John? Do you think he would be in safety
enough?' 'I wish with all my heart we had him here,' replied
John, 'for he would be safe enough.' 'Well then,' said MacLeod,
'he is here already. He is just now in your house. But when
you go in you must be careful to take no notice of him at all.
He passes for one Lewie Caw, my servant.' John faithfully
promised to observe the direction, and thought he could perform
it well enough. But he was no sooner entred the house
than he could not hold his eyes from staring upon Lewie,
and very soon he was forced to turn his face away from the
Prince and to weep. In this house the Prince diverted himself
with a young child, Neil MacKinnon,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> carrying him in his arms
and singing to him, and said, 'I hope this child may be a
captain in my service yet.'</p>

<p>The Prince and Malcolm began to deliberate about going
to the continent, and the proper measures to be taken for
that purpose. They both agreed not to let the old Laird of
MacKinnon know anything of their being in that country,
because though he be a mighty honest, stout, good man, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
through his old age, and the infirmities attending it, they
thought he was not so well cut out for the difficulties of the
Prince's present situation, and therefore they judged it advisable
to desire John MacKinnon to hire a boat under a pretence
of Malcolm MacLeod's only sailing to the continent, taking his
[<em>fol.</em> 246.]
promise in the meantime that he should not communicate anything
of the matter at all to the old Laird if he should chance
to see him. Accordingly John went to hire the boat, and
meeting with the old chiftain he could not keep the matter
from him. The Laird told John that he should get a right
boat and manage that matter well enough, and that he would
instantly come to the place where the Prince was. John
returned to the Prince and told him what he had done, and
that old MacKinnon was coming to wait upon him. Upon
this Malcolm represented to the Prince that seeing they were
upon the bounds of the old Laird and that he had taken the
matter in hand, he behoved to order and direct everything,
for that if he should take upon him to give his opinion or
contradict honest MacKinnon in anything he should propose,
a difference might arise that would not be so convenient in the
present juncture. And therefore suggested it as a wise thing
that he should leave the Prince altogether to the management
of old MacKinnon, who he was persuaded would be very careful
of him, and exceedingly true and firm to the trust. The
Prince did not savour this proposal at all, for he could not
think of parting with his trusty friend. But the Captain
insisted upon it as advisable upon other accounts. He told
the Prince that now he behoved to be amissing among his
own friends and acquaintances, and ten to one but parties
would be employed in search of him, which, if they should still
keep together, might end in making a discovery of them both;
[<em>fol.</em> 247.]
and that therefore he would chuse rather to return to the
place from whence he came, though he should happen to have
the misfortune of being made a prisoner, which was very like
to be the case. 'And no matter for that at all,' said he, 'if
it can tend to promote your safety, which it cannot readily
fail to do.' With much reluctancy the Prince at last agreed
to the proposal, and upon old MacKinnon's coming to them
they went directly to the boat, John MacKinnon going with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
them, who likewise accompanied the Prince and old MacKinnon
to the continent.</p>

<p>When the Prince was about stepping into the boat, about
8 or 9 at night, he turned to Malcolm and said, 'Don't you
remember that I promised to meet Murdoch MacLeod at such
a place?'<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> 'No matter,' said Malcolm, 'I shall make your
apology.' 'That's not enough,' said the Prince. 'Have you
paper, pen and ink upon you, MacLeod? I'll write him a few
lines. I'm obliged so to do in good manners.' Accordingly
he wrote him in the following words:</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;I thank God I am in good health, and have got off
as design'd. Remember me to all friends, and thank them for
the trouble they have been at.&mdash;I am, Sir, Your humble servant,</p>

<p class="sig">

<p>Elliguil, July 4th, 1746.'<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><br />The Prince delivered the letter into the Captain's hands,
and then asked him if he could light him a pipe, for he wanted
[<em>fol.</em> 248.]
to smoke in the passage. The Captain desir'd him to have
the cutty ready in his cheek, and that he should fall upon a
method to light it. Malcolm took some tow out of his pocket,
and snapping one of the guns held the tow to the pan and
kindled it. Then putting it to the mouth of the pipe he blew
and the Prince smok'd. But the cuttie being exceedingly
short, Malcolm scarred the Prince's cheek with the tow.</p>

<p>At parting the Prince presented the Captain with a silver
stock-buckle, which among all his difficulties he has still got
preserv'd; and embracing him in his arms saluted him twice,
and bad God bless him, putting ten guineas into his hand.
Malcolm positively refused to accept of the gold, because the
Prince behoved to have great use for money in his wandering
from place to place; and he said he believed he had not much
about him at that time. The Prince pressed it upon him and
would have no refusal, wishing it had been much more for his
sake, and that he could have gone to the continent with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<p>Captain MacLeod took care to have one of the cutties the
Prince had used and carried it to London with him, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
meeting with one, Dr. Burton of York, a prisoner, and chancing
to tell the story of the cuttie the Doctor begged as a great
favour to have the cuttie, which Malcolm gave him. The
Doctor has made a fine shagreen case for it, and preserves it
as a valuable rarity. This Dr. Burton was made prisoner
[<em>fol.</em> 249.]
upon a suspicion of his having crossed England with an intention
to kiss the Prince's hands. Malcolm in coming down from
London made a stop at York for a day or two, and visited the
Doctor and his cuttie.</p>

<p>Captain MacLeod,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> after taking leave of the Prince made the
best of his way back again to Raaza, and on his way visited
Mrs. MacDonald of Kingsburgh, to whom he told the whole
adventure, particularly the story of the motto and carving
upon the silver-mill she had given to the Prince; and how the
Prince said that the wind would soon change and set the ships
of war off from the coast, which Malcolm said accordingly
happened.</p>

<p>After Malcolm had returned to Raaza, parties landed upon
the island to rummage it. One day a party of red-coats happened
to be pretty near him before he spied them. He and a
servant he had with him took to their heels and ran for it.
The party did not fire but called upon them to stop. Endeavouring
to get clear of this party, he had almost run himself
into the hands of Captain Caroline Scott, upon the head of
fifty or sixty men. Scott ordered his party to fire at Malcolm
and his servant, and to run after them.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> They catched the
poor servant, and would have him to tell if yon was the Pretender
that had got off from them; and because he would not
[<em>fol.</em> 250.]
say it was the Pretender, they tortured him so that they
left him for dead upon the spot. But whether or not the poor
man (Donald Nicolson) recovered was what Malcolm had never
yet discovered. Malcolm ran to the clift of a rock upon the
sea-shore, where he said no person would ever run but in the
greatest necessity, so difficult it was of access. There he
remained three days and three nights, having only some
crumbs of bread and cheese in his pocket. But being like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to starve of hunger and thirst, he left his cliff and came once
more upon the island. One day happening to take a nap in a
house, an alarm came that a party of MacLeods from Sky was
near, and before he could get out at the door the party was
hard at hand. Once more he ran to the old clift, the party
firing at him and crying after him to stop; but he continued
running with all speed, and they endeavoured to outrun him
but could not. In his way to the clift he happened to meet
with a boy whom he took along with him, lest he should have
fallen into the hands of the party, and perhaps have discovered
which way he saw him running. He remained in the clift
three days more. The boy growing weary of the cold and
hungry quarters, frequently pressed to be gone. But the
Captain could not well think of that, for fear of a discovery.
However, at last he allowed the boy to go, taking his promise
that he would fetch him some provisions and intelligence, and
that he would not discover where he had left him. The poor
[<em>fol.</em> 251.]
boy soon fell into the hands of the same party, who by threats
forced him to tell what he knew. Malcolm rising up to look
about him a little, spied six MacLeods creeping in about to the
clift with their muskets cock'd. He had no way left him to
escape; but having some gold upon him he offered them every
farthing of it, provided they would let him go and shift for
himself, which they refused to do, even though they were his
own blood-relations, and the party commanded by his friend,
John MacLeod of Talisker. They carried him prisoner to a
command of fusiliers at Pourtree in Sky. From thence he was
guarded by a party to the sloop, commanded by that cruel,
barbarous man, John Ferguson of Aberdeenshire.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 2.</div>

<p>When he was to go on board his wife and some other friends
came flocking about him, weeping bitterly and lamenting his
fate. He very pleasantly desired them to dry up their tears,
for that he hoped to return yet from London in coach. This
merry saying of his prov'd not amiss, for he came from London
in a post-chaise with Miss Flora MacDonald, passing for one
Mr. Robertson, and Miss, for his sister; they not chusing to
discover themselves upon the road, lest the mob might insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
them and use them ill. They arrived in Edinburgh upon
Sunday's evening, August 2nd, 1747.</p>

<p>Though Ferguson could not fail to know Captain MacLeod
to be a gentleman both from his manner and the cloaths he
had upon him (for he was very genteelly dress'd in scarlet
[<em>fol.</em> 252.]
cloath and fine tartan), yet he was never pleased to vouchsafe
him one single look but in the way of surliness and ill-nature.
He was oblig'd to retire every evening by eight
o'clock with the other prisoners to the place assigned them
under deck, where they had their choice of lying upon cable
ropes, boards, or stones, without any covering, and had only
half-men's allowance given them of very coarse indifferent
fare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 July</div>

<p>Before the Captain got to London his cloaths were so wore
that the skin began to appear through them, and by that time
he had not one shirt to change another. Though he had been
an officer in the Prince's service under his chiftain, the Laird
of Raaza, yet he had the good luck to get off by a mistake,
for he was thought when brought to London to be Raaza himself,
both whose feet turn inwards; and when Malcolm's feet
were examined by order, the return given was 'that they were
both straight and stout.' However, his name being much
talked of and growing somewhat famous over all London, the
Government had a mind once more to be at him, and sent the
evidences to visit him to see if they knew him, and if they did
not know him, to endeavour to fish something out of him by
entangling him in his talk. Particularly one, Urquhart, came
to him in a very kind and familiar manner, and inquiring about
his welfare. Captain MacLeod told him that he had the
[<em>fol.</em> 253.]
advantage of him, for that he was at a loss to know who it
was that favoured him with such a kind visit, not remembring
he had ever seen the face before. 'O Mr. MacLeod,' said
Urquhart, 'don't you remember to have seen me at Edinburgh
at such a time?' It happened very luckily for Malcolm
that he had never been in Edinburgh before that time, and
therefore he assured Urquhart that he behoved to take him
for some other person. Raaza and his men had come only to
Perth sometime before Falkirk battle. Urquhart still insisted
that he was sure he had seen him before, particularly at Inverness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
at such a time. The Captain still kept him off with long
weapons and discreet returns; so that neither Urquhart nor
none of his kidney could gain any ground upon him at all.
There being no evidence to be found against him, he had the
benefit of the indemnity. Accordingly he was liberate out of
the messengers hands upon July 4th, 1747, together with
Clanranald, senior, and his lady, Boisdale, John MacKinnon,
my Lady Stewart, etc. Miss Flora MacDonald was not liberate
till some few days after.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745
September</div>

<p>Captain MacLeod gave likewise the following remarkable
narrative:<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> After the battle of Gladesmuir, a Glenelg man
came over to Sky to give the accounts of it. Upon this Sir
Alexander MacDonald, the Laird of Raaza, Kingsburgh and
[<em>fol.</em> 254.]
Captain MacLeod had a meeting some time in the end of September,
1745, at Sconsary, a publick house in the Isle of Sky.
When Sir Alexander came to the place, he desired that none
might be present but friends. The company assured him that
the Glenelg man was a very honest fellow; but Sir Alexander
would not hear of his witnessing what passed among them, and
therefore he was not admitted.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander said that this was certainly a most remarkable
and surprizing victory the Prince had obtained; that he
doubted not now of the Prince's succeeding in the attempt;
and that therefore every one should raise his men to assist him
in the design. Then directing his discourse to Raaza, he said,
'Raaza, tis true you cannot raise many men; but the men you
have are good. You can easily raise an hundred, and I resolve
to raise nine hundred, which will make out a thousand good
stout fellows betwixt us: for I am not for having boys or
superannuate men amongst them. These I would divide into
two battalions, 500 in each; and as you are a man that one
can confide in, I resolve to make you Colonel of one of the
battalions.' Raaza most cheerfully accepted of the offer, and
heartily thanked Sir Alexander for the command he designed
to honour him with. Then the marching off the men was laid
down by Sir Alexander himself,&mdash;that Raaza should go off
with his battalion first, and that Sir Alexander should follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 255.]
at the distance of a day's march; and the particular places for
quartering on the march were condescended upon. They likewise
agreed upon what number of cattle they should drive
along with each battalion for provisions till they should come
to the low country, where they would get plenty. In a word,
all matters were most amicably and frankly resolved upon for
joining the Prince's standard without loss of time, and the
company were highly delighted with the interview. Sir Alexander
stayed all that night in the same house, making very
merry, and taking a hearty glass with the gentlemen.</p>

<p>Next day the post brought letters to Sir Alexander from
President Forbes and the Laird of MacLeod, then at Culloden,
which were delivered to him in presence of the company. He
stept aside to a window and read the letters by himself, not
allowing the company to know anything of the contents.
Immediately he left his former chearfulness and frank way,
and was quite upon the grave and thoughtful. He spoke not
one word more of the matter, and left the company soon like
one in confusion. To the importunities of the President and
MacLeod had Sir Alexander in an instant yielded himself up
entirely, and dropt the declared resolution of his own mind.</p>

<p>Just as Sir Alexander went away, Malcolm MacLeod asked
[<em>fol.</em> 256.]
at Kingsburgh what was become of yesternight's resolution,
for that he was much surprized at Sir Alexander's leaving
them so abruptly and dryly. Kingsburgh said he knew as
little what was become of that affair as Mr. MacLeod did, but
he was afraid that there would be no more of it. When Captain
MacLeod was asked whether or not he thought that Lady
Margaret MacDonald had any influence upon Sir Alexander to
make him change his resolution; his answer was, that from all
he knew of that matter he could not discover any reason to
believe that Lady Margaret had any influence at all in the
affair upon Sir Alexander.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>c.</em> June.</div>

<p>After giving this narrative, Malcolm likewise told that
before the Prince's arrival Sir Alexander MacDonald had been
with Boisdale, brother of the Laird of Clanranald, and who
lives in South Uist, with whom he had a conference about the
Prince's designing to come over; insinuating that he intended
to land first in some part of the Long Isle, and perhaps might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
send for Boisdale; adding withal that if he should happen to
come without a backing, he could wish he would return to
France. To this purpose Sir Alexander left a message with
Boisdale to the Prince, importuning him, if he arrived without
a following to return and wait for a more favourable opportunity,
[<em>fol.</em> 257.]
and till he should get matters in better order for the
attempt.</p>

<p>When Boisdale came to the Prince upon his first landing
he delivered the message to him, and did all he could to
support the purport of it. The Prince asked Boisdale if he
thought that he would get a hundred men to join him. 'No
doubt,' said Boisdale, 'you'll get more than a hundred. But
what then, though you get 500? what will that do?' 'Well
then,' said the Prince, 'if I can get only a hundred good stout
honest-hearted fellows to join me, I'll make a trial what I can
do.' Although Boisdale spoke to the Prince in a very discouraging
way, and after the standard was set up kept back
all Clanranald's men that lived in South Uist and the other
Isles to the number of four or five hundred good men (for he
had more to say with them than either Clanranald himself or
his son), yet to do Boisdale justice, he was of great use to the
Prince when wandering up and down through South Uist,
Benbicula, and other parts of the Long Isle, and exerted his
utmost endeavours (with the assistance of honest Armadale) to
keep him out of the hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>As to the several parts of the above sentence particular
questions were asked at Malcolm MacLeod, and in his answers
he gave a plain account of Boisdale's conduct, both before and
after the Prince's distress, and particularly mentioned what
number of men Clanranald might be reckoned to have in the
Isles. Both the Captain and James MacDonald, joiner (in
[<em>fol.</em> 258.]
whose house this Journal was given), agreed in affirming that
Clanranald had in the Isles four or five hundred good men,
and upon the continent three hundred. These upon the continent
were the only men that followed young Clanranald in
the Prince's service.</p>

<p>Captain MacLeod likewise gave the following account of the
great danger the Prince was in of being taken prisoner in the
retreat from Sterling to Inverness:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">16 Feb.</div>

<div class="sidenote">17 Feb.</div>

<p>The Prince, one night, quartering in the Laird of MacIntosh's
house, had not many about him for a guard, and these too dispersed
up and down for proper quarters, there being no apprehension at all
of any danger. Lord Loudon, then at Inverness, got intelligence
that the Prince was that night to sleep in MacIntosh's house
with no great guard about him. When it was dark, orders were
given the men to be in readiness upon a minute's warning, and
accordingly Lord Loudon marched off with about seventeen hundred
men.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a
href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> When the Prince
was about going to rest, or rather when it became dark, Lady
MacIntosh ordered one Frazer, a blacksmith (who happened to be there
by chance, having a desire to see the Prince), and four servants to
get loaded muskets, and to go away privately beyond all the guards
and sentries without allowing them to know anything about them or
their design, and to walk on the fields all night, and to keep a
good look-out. Thereby she said they would prove a check upon the
guards, and would be ready to discover approaching [<em>fol.</em> 259.]
danger, if any should happen before the sentries could know anything
of the matter. All this proceeded merely from Lady MacIntosh's
great care and anxiety about the Prince. The blacksmith and his
faithful four accordingly went pretty far beyond all the sentries,
and walked up and down upon a muir, at the distance, Captain MacLeod
said he believed, of two miles from MacIntosh's house. At last they
spied betwixt them and the sky a great body of men moving towards
them, and not at a great distance. The blacksmith fired his musket
and killed one of Loudon's men, some say, the piper; but Captain
MacLeod said he could not positively affirm anything about that
particular.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a
href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The four
servants followed the blacksmith's example, and it is thought
they too did some execution. Upon this the blacksmith huzzaed and
cried aloud, 'Advance, Advance, my lads, Advance! (naming some
particular regiments) I think we have the dogs now.' This so struck
Lord Loudon's men with horrour that instantly they wheel'd about,
after firing some shots, and in great confusion ran back with
speed to Inverness. It is thought that Lord Loudon's men<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
who fired wounded some of their own companions. An express had been sent
off privately to Lady MacIntosh by some friend in Inverness to warn
her of the danger. He came to the house much about the time that
the trusty five discovered [<em>fol.</em> 260.] the body of men advancing
towards them. Lady MacIntosh ran directly to the room where the
Prince was fast asleep and gave him notice of Lord Loudon's design.
Instantly he jumped out of bed and would have been going down stairs
directly, but Lady MacIntosh importuned him to stay in the room
till she should get him further notice and try what could be done.
They were soon put out of any apprehension of danger. Some of Lord
Loudon's men, through the darkness of the night mistaking their
way, fell into the hands of the guard, and told that when they were
ordered to march from Inverness they were not allowed to know where
they were going, and that Lord Loudon upon the firing should have
said, 'There's an end to this; we are certainly discovered.' He was
the prettiest fellow that could make Inverness first. The firing
of the five alarmed the guard, and quickly put them and others in
motion. But Loudon and his men were far out of reach before they
could come to the ground where the firing happen'd. Clanranald's men
were that night keeping guard upon the Prince, and Captain MacLeod,
being in the neighbourhood, was amongst the number of those that were
alarm'd with the firing and made haste to come up.</p>

<p>Among other subjects the Prince and Captain MacLeod in
their wanderings happen'd to talk of the above remarkable
incident when the Prince was pleased to inform him that the
[<em>fol.</em> 261.]
Laird of MacIntosh himself (in Lord Loudon's command) was
the kind friend that had sent off the express from Inverness to
give notice of the danger. The Prince said he had a very good
opinion of that gentleman.</p>

<p>After the hurry of the alarm was over, the Prince ordered
all the men to be got together and to march directly for Inverness;
and when they were approaching that town he drew
them up in order of battle, expecting, as was given out, that
Lord Loudon was to march out of the town to fight. For a
considerable way they marched in order of battle, and when
they came near Inverness they saw Lord Loudon and his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
making all the haste they could out of it, betaking themselves
to ships and boats to carry them off. The Prince and his
army entred the town without opposition or violence of any
kind.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1747
13 Aug.</div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Upon Thursday, August 13th, 1747, Captain Malcolm
MacLeod and James MacDonald, joiner, dined
with my Lady Bruce in the Citadel of Leith. After
dinner they were so kind as to retire to my room, where
they staid till between six and seven at night. The
Captain was but poorly provided for in money matters,
and therefore a contribution was set on foot for him in
and about Edinburgh. I was so happy<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> as to make
among my acquaintances six guineas and a crown, which
I delivered into his own hand. I then told him the
[<em>fol.</em> 262.]
freedom I had taken in writing down from my memory
the conversation he had honoured me with, Friday last,
in presence of Stewart Carmichael and James MacDonald,
but that I still wanted to have an additional
favour of him, which was, that he would be so good as
to allow me to read my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima cura</i> in his hearing, in
order to get his observations and amendments upon it.
He frankly granted my request, and said he was glad
to embrace the opportunity of so much exactness,
which had never been used with him in any one of the
many conversations he had formerly given. He was
pleased to declare his being much satisfied with what I
had written and said, he would now tell me some things
he had not mentioned before, which accordingly I writ
in his own words, always reading over every sentence to
him for the greater certainty of the facts being exactly
and circumstantially narrated. I have been carefull to
insert these particulars in their proper places in the
above transcript. There was one thing I had some
difficulty rightly to adjust with Captain MacLeod, which
was the day of the month when he parted with the
Prince after seeing him in the boat with old MacKinnon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
When I asked him about this, he said it was
upon July 4th.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> I told him that would not answer at
all with the days formerly mentioned by him, and that
it behoved to be July 5th. He was still positive that
[<em>fol</em>. 263.] was the 4th, 'For,' said he, 'I remember nothing
better than that I set it down upon a piece of paper
lest I should forget it.' [The difficulty was still like to
remain unresolved, he being equally positive both as to
the days formerly mentioned by him, and the particular
day upon which he parted with the Prince, till it luckily
came into my mind to ask him how many days he
reckoned in June? He answered, Thirty-one, which
mistake served to clear up this point.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>] Captain MacLeod
said he expected his brother-in-law, John MacKinnon,
soon down from London, and then suggested
to James MacDonald that if John should happen to
come by the way of Edinburgh, he should be at pains
to procure a meeting betwixt the said Mr. MacKinnon
and me, and that (considering the exactness I observed)
James MacDonald should lay himself out to get me a
meeting with Donald MacLeod, Miss Flora MacDonald,
and any others if they came in his reach that could be
useful in making a discovery of facts and men. To which
Mr. MacDonald answered, he would do all that lay in
his power.</p>

<p>I then took occasion to acquaint Captain MacLeod
about a report that had passed currently in Kingsburgh's
name after he had set out from Edinburgh in
his return to Sky. The report was this, that Kingsburgh
[<em>fol</em>. 264.] should have declared to several persons that the
Laird of MacLeod should have writ him a letter, desiring
him to deliver up the Prince, if he should happen
to come in his way, and representing to him what a
service he would thereby do to his country; and that
the said Laird should have come to Kingsburgh (as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
story gave out) either at Fort Augustus or in the
Castle of Edinburgh, desiring to have that letter up
from him again, which Kingsburgh refused to comply
with. Several persons (knowing that I had frequently
and familiarly conversed with Kingsburgh) had come
to me enquiring about the above report if I knew anything
of the matter. My answer always was, that as
Kingsburgh had never so much as made the most distant
hint to me about any letter whatsomever from the
Laird of MacLeod, I could say nothing either as to the
truth or the falshood of that report.</p>

<p>After informing Captain MacLeod about this story as
above, I told him what a desire I had to have this
particular cleared up, that if the report was false and
calumnious it might be contradicted, and if true, it
might be recorded in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">futuram rei memoriam</i>; and then
asked him if he would be so good as to take from me a
memorandum to Kingsburgh about this matter. He
said he would with all his heart, and that he would
likewise lay himself out to expiscate facts and transmit
exact accounts of them to me by any sure private hand

<div class="sidenote">22 Aug.</div>

<p>Upon Saturday, August 22nd, I met once more with
Captain MacLeod about 3 o'clock afternoon in the
house of James MacDonald, joiner, when the Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
was making ready to pass over to Kingborn, which
accordingly he did that night. I put him in mind of
the above Memorandum, and asked the favour of him
to take John MacKinnon's account from his own mouth
and transmit it to me, as I had heard that Mr. MacKinnon
had taken the opportunity of a ship bound for
Inverness from some part of the coast of England, and
therefore I could not expect to have a meeting with
him. Then I begged him to try if Armadale would
vouchsafe me a written account of his part of the
management, and to exert his endeavours to pick up
for me an exact narrative of all the cruelties, barbarities,
etc., he could get any right intelligence about.
The Captain was pleased to come under a promise that
[<em>fol</em>. 266.] he would do his utmost to comply with my desires as to
all these particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17 Aug.
1747</div>

<p>Citadel of Leith, Monday, August 17th, betwixt six and
seven at night, 1747, Deacon William Clerk, taylor, came to
see me, and did me the favour of bringing along with him
Donald MacLeod (tenant at Gualtergill, in the Isle of Sky,
under the Laird of MacLeod), the honest and faithful steersman
of the eight-oar'd boat from the continent to the Isles of
Benbicula, South Uist, Lewis, etc. etc. etc., and who had the
Prince among his hands, and was employed in going upon his
errands for nine or ten weeks after the battle of Culloden.</p>

<p>After the usual compliments and some little chit-chat, I
took occasion to inform Donald anent the favour I had
obtained of Malcolm MacLeod, and how easily and chearfully
he had granted my request, begging in the meantime to have
the like favour from him, as his history, taking in so much
time, behoved to be very interesting. Honest Donald modestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
said he would very willingly grant my desire for all that he
had to say would take up no great time&mdash;it would easily be
contained in a quarter of a sheet of paper. But then he said,
as he had heard that I had been employing myself in collecting
[<em>fol.</em> 267.]
these things, he behoved to hear all the accounts I had
gathered together, particularly O'Neil's Journal, before he
would give me one word. I begged leave to tell him that I
was persuaded his account would take up much more than a
quarter of a sheet, considering the length of time he happened
to be with the Prince in his greatest distresses, and that I
would willingly read to him all that I had collected, but that
it consisted of so many sheets that I was afraid it would take
up too much of our time, which I would chuse much rather to
spend in taking his account in writing from his own mouth.
However, I said I could easily gratify him in reading O'Neil's
Journal, as it happened not to be of any great length. He
said he would content himself with O'Neil's Journal only, as
he had been along with him in company all the time he had
attended the Prince after the battle of Culloden. For this
made him the more anxious to know what O'Neil advanced in
his journal, as he himself could judge where O'Neil was in the
right and where in the wrong.</p>

<p>I then represented to him that if he would indulge me the
freedom of asking questions at him (without which, from
experience, I could assure him there was no taking of journals
[<em>fol.</em> 268.]
from one with any tolerable exactness), he would soon see that
his journal behoved to take up much more paper than he
imagined. He said he would allow me to ask any questions I
should think fit to propose. I asked him where he was to be
that night. He told me he resolved to sleep in James MacDonald's
house. I desired to attend him and to spend the
evening with him, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>When we were in James's house I began to ask some questions,
to which Donald gave plain answers. After asking
several questions, Donald, looking at James MacDonald with
a smiling countenance, spoke in Erse to him; and James
laughing very heartily, said to me, 'Do you know, Sir, what
Donald was saying just now? He says you are the uncoest
cheel he ever met wi'; for if you go on in asking questions so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
particularly, and if he shall tell you all the nig-nacs o't, he
believes indeed his account will take up much more time and
paper than be imagined.'</p>

<p>Upon this I told him it was not enough to inform me that
the Prince and his small retinue were in this or the other place
such a day, and that they did breakfast, dine, or sup here or
there, which I acknowledge to be the foundation of the Journal.
But then there were many other things that ought to be carefully
[<em>fol.</em> 269.]
remarked and taken notice of, otherwise the Journal
would turn out to be only a very dull, insipid thing. I therefore
earnestly begged he would be at pains to recollect himself
as much as possible, and inform me exactly what particular
dangers and distresses they met with, how the Prince bore up
under them, what passed in conversation among them, and
more especially that he would endeavour to call to mind the
sayings of the Prince upon any subject, etc. Then a particular
day was fixed (Thursday, August 20th) for meeting together
in the same house at nine o'clock in the morning, in order to
write the Journal from Donald's own mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 Aug.</div>

<p>Betwixt 9 and 10 of the said day, I was sent for and found
with Donald, Deacon William Clerk, taylor, and one Mr.
Finlayson, mathematical instrument-maker, and late engineer
in the Prince's army. I had no sooner entred the room than
Donald asked me if I had been as good as my word,&mdash;if I had
brought along with me O'Neil's Journal? for that, he said, the
deel a word would he gie me till he should hear O'Neil's
Journal, which he was afraid was far from being right. And
this he said he had reason to think from what he had heard
about it already in conversation. I then read O'Neil's Journal
[<em>fol.</em> 270.]
to him, in which he found fault with several things, particularly
as to the staving of the boat to pieces, which he said was
not fact. 'For,' said he, 'if the boat had staved to pieces,
where O'Neil mentions, the world could not have saved one
life that was on board. We would certainly have all perished
in the sea; that place is so very rocky and dangerous.
Besides, I have reason to think that the boat is still to the
fore, and that I may get her into my custody when I go home,
if I please to seek after her.' He likewise quarrell'd O'Neil's
asserting that he went with him (Donald) to Stornway, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he said was not fact, but that he (O'Neil) remained with the
Prince, while he himself was employed about the message upon
which he was dispatched to Stornway, where he was well
known. He also blamed O'Neil for not taking any notice of
the Prince's being under a necessity to disguise himself in
women's cloaths, which consisted with O'Neil's knowledge, and
served as much as anything to represent the great danger the
Prince was in of being discovered and seized; and for taking
(as Donald said) too much of the praise to himself. Here
Donald had a remarkable expression which I cannot fail to set
down in his own words, and they are these: 'What a deel
[<em>fol.</em> 271.]
could O'Neil do for the preservation and safety o' the Prince
in a Highland country, where he knew not a foot of ground,
and had not the language o' the people. And sic far'd o' him,
for he was no sooner frae the Prince than he was tane prisoner.
I own he was as faithful and trusty a friend as the Prince or
any man could have, and made an excellent companion to him.
But then he could have done nothing for his preservation if
there had not been some Highland body like mysell wi' them.
Faith he taks ower mickell to himsell; and he is not blate to
mind himsell sae mickle and to forget others that behoved to
do much more than he could do in sic a case.'</p>

<p>Donald found fault with some other instances in O'Neil's
Journal, which it is needless to particularize; for the above
particulars are sufficient for a specimen. In general he said
the Journal was not at all just and exact.</p>

<p>Mr. Finlayson too found fault with O'Neil's account of the
battle of Culloden, and said that in that matter he was far
from being right.</p>

<p>After reading O'Neil's Journal, Deacon Clerk and Mr.
Finlayson went off. But luckily Malcolm MacLeod came to
us, to whom I resumed what had passed upon O'Neil's Journal.
[<em>fol.</em> 272.]
Malcolm said he had reason to think that O'Neil's account was
not just in several things, for that it consisted with his knowledge
that O'Neil had advanced several things in London that
would not stand the test. He said he could not have a good
opinion of O'Neil when he was not at the pains to call for Donald
MacLeod, his companion in distress, whom he could not fail
to know to be in London at the very same time he himself was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in it, and to whom he could have had easy access at any time
he pleased. Mean time Malcolm joined with Donald in asserting
that he believed O'Neil was most faithful and trusty to
the Prince, and would do any thing or run any risque to promote
his interest. But then he could not help observing that
it was impossible for O'Neil to do anything for the safety of
the Prince in a country where he was altogether a stranger,
and behoved to be at a very great loss for want of the
language.</p>

<p>When I was beginning to take down Donald's account in
writing, he told me it was not in his power (as I had asked
him) to remember particularly the days of the month in such
a long time; but he would do his best to call to mind how
many days and nights they had been in this and the other
[<em>fol.</em> 273.]
place, and from that I might if I pleased at my own leisure
afterwards make out the days of the month so as to agree with
April 20th or 21st, the day on which he met with the Prince
in the wood, and undertook to pilot him to the Isles; and to
make his parting with the Prince to come within three or four
days of the time when the Prince and Miss MacDonald went
off together to the Isle of Sky; which, he said, was exactly the
case. He desired me to fix their setting out from the Continent
on board the eight-oar'd boat to the 26th of April, and
then he said I might make out the other days of the month at
my own leisure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17 Feb.</div>

<p>Donald MacLeod<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> coming to Inverness (when Lord Loudon
and his men were lying in and about that town) with a view
of taking in a cargoe of meal for the inhabitants of Sky,
happened to make a much longer stay there than at first he
had proposed, the weather having proved very stormy and
cross. When the Prince and his army were marching towards
Inverness, Lord Loudon and his men gave out that they were
resolved to fight them, and accordingly (as they pretended)
made ready for battle, the pipes playing and the drums beating
to arms; when in an instant, instead of fighting they
wheel'd about and made off with speed, some to the old citadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
(called Cromwell's Fort), and others to the bridge, in order to
[<em>fol.</em> 274.]
get on board of ships and boats, the better to make their
escape.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Donald, walking along the bridge to see what course
they were to take, chanced to fall in with his own chiftain,
the Laird of MacLeod, who asked him how he was to dispose
of himself now. Donald said he was to go back to Inverness
for a horse he had there, for that he thought it foolish for him
to lose his horse whatever might happen. The Laird forbad
him to do any such thing, assuring him he would certainly be
made a prisoner by the rebels if he returned into the town.
Donald replied he was very indifferent whether he was made a
prisoner or not, being confident that they would not do any
harm to him that was nothing but a poor auld man. The
Laird walked back with him as if he had been wanting some
thing out of the town till they came near the gate next to the
bridge, where they began to hear the pipes of the Prince's
army playing very briskly; and then the Laird thought fit to
turn tail and run with speed. Donald never ance fashed himself,
but went into the town at his own leisure, where he had
not been long till he fell in with the MacDonalds of Glencoe,
who took him prisoner, and would have him to give up his
broadsword, 'which,' said Donald, 'I was unco unwilling to
[<em>fol.</em> 275.]
part wi', for it was a piece of very good stuff.' But luckily for
him the old Laird of MacKinnon came up, who, taking him
by the hand and asking very kindly about his welfare, assured
the party that Donald was an honest man, and that he would
be bail for him. Upon which they allowed Donald to keep
the claymore and to go along with MacKinnon. After this
Donald had no great inclination to leave Inverness, but
saunter'd about among his good friends and acquaintances in
the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>About the beginning of April 1746, Æneas MacDonald
(one of Kinlochmoidart's brothers, and a banker at Paris)
sent for Donald MacLeod and told him that he heard that he
(Donald) knew the coast well, and likewise the course to the
different Isles, and that as he was upon going to the island of
Barra for a small sum of money that was lying there, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
about £380 Sterling, he was desirous to have him for his pilot
and guide. Donald MacLeod very frankly agreed to do that,
or anything else in his power to promote the Prince's interest.
On board they go, and though the sea was swarming with
sloops of war, boats and yawls full of militia, viz., the Campbells,
the MacLeods, and MacDonalds of Sky, etc., yet they
had the good luck to get safe to Barra, where they got the
money. But they behoved to remove from place to place for
[<em>fol.</em> 276.]
fear of being discovered and taken, when Æneas and Donald
were in Barra. John Ferguson (captain of the <em>Furnace</em> sloop)
came upon the coast of the Island, and sent a letter to MacDonald
of Boisdale (in whose house Æneas and Donald had
been) by a yawl full of the MacLeods, desiring Boisdale to come
on board and speak with him. When the MacLeods returned
to the sloop, they informed Captain Ferguson that they had
seen Donald MacLeod upon shore; and they were persuaded he
was about no good. He behoved to be about some mischief
or another, for well did they know him, and what way he
would be employed. After this Æneas and Donald were
obliged to be more wary and cautious than ever, and were
much put to it how to get off, as the sloops, boats, etc., were
cruizing in great numbers about all the places of the Long
Isle. At last they got off with the cash to the island of Cana,
at the distance of ten leagues from South Uist towards the
mainland. From thence they sailed to the island of Egg,
twelve miles from Cana; and from Egg they steered their
course to the mainland, where they arrived at Kinlochmoidart's
house, which is about six or seven leagues from Egg.</p>

<p>About four or five days after they came to Kinlochmoidart
they were thinking of setting out for Inverness, when Æneas
MacDonald received a letter from the Prince containing the
[<em>fol.</em> 277.]
accounts of the battle of Culloden. Æneas said to Donald
that he had very bad news to give him, and then told him
that the Prince and his army had been totally routed near
Culloden house. In this letter Æneas was ordered to meet the
Prince at Boradale, and immediately upon receipt of the letter
he set out, and returned that same night to Kinlochmoidart.
About two days after this, Lord Elcho and Captain O'Neil
came to Kinlochmoidart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">20 April</div>

<p>In one day three several messages (for the greater security
lest any one of them should happen to miscarry or come by
any misfortune) came to Donald MacLeod desiring him forthwith
to go to the Prince at Boradale, which order he obeyed
directly. When Donald came to Boradale, the first man he
met with was the Prince in a wood, all alone. This was about
four or five days after the battle. April 20th or 21st.</p>

<p>[It is to be remarked here when Donald spoke to the Prince
he always used these terms, May it please your Majesty, or
May it please your excellency.]</p>

<p>The Prince, making towards Donald, asked, 'Are you
Donald MacLeod of Guatergill in Sky?' 'Yes,' said Donald,
'I am the same man, may it please your Majesty, at your service.
What is your pleasure wi' me?' 'Then,' said the
Prince, 'You see, Donald, I am in distress. I therefore throw
myself into your bosom, and let you do with me what you like.
I hear you are an honest man, and fit to be trusted.'</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 278.] When Donald was giving me this part of the narrative he
grat sare, the tears came running down his cheeks; and he
said, 'Wha deel could help greeting when speaking on sic a
sad subject?' Donald made this return to the Prince. 'Alas,
may it please your excellency, what can I do for you? for I
am but a poor auld man, and can do very little for mysell.'
'Why,' said the Prince, 'the service I am to put you upon I
know you can perform very well. It is that you may go with
letters from me to Sir Alexander MacDonald and the Laird of
MacLeod. I desire therefore to know if you will undertake
this piece of service; for I am really convinced that these
gentlemen for all that they have done, will do all in their
power to protect me.' Upon hearing this Donald was struck
with surprize, and plainly told the Prince he would do anything
but that. It was a task he would not undertake if he
should hang him for refusing. 'What,' said Donald, 'does
not your excellency know that these men have played the
rogue to you altogether, and will you trust them for a' that?
Na, you mauna do 't.' Then Donald informed the Prince that
Sir Alexander MacDonald and the Laird of MacLeod were
then, with forces along with them, in search of him not above
the distance of ten or twelve miles by sea from him, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
much greater distance by land; and therefore the sooner he
left that place the better, not knowing how soon they might
come up to it, especially if they should happen to take their
[<em>fol.</em> 279.]
course by sea. Donald still repeated his dislike of the measure
in sending any message to Sir Alexander MacDonald and the
Laird of MacLeod, and said he would not risque upon going
any message to these gentlemen from the Prince at any rate
(in the present circumstances) for more reasons than one.</p>

<p>At this time, very luckily for the Prince, Cumberland and
his army entertain'd the notion that he had set sail from the
continent for St. Kilda, being a place so remote that no suspicion
would be readily entertained of his being there. Upon
this General Campbell was dispatched with such a considerable
force as took up all the fleet that was upon the coast, but to
no purpose. When General Campbell appeared upon the
coast of St. Kilda, the greater part of the poor inhabitants ran
off to the clifts of their rocks to hide themselves, being
frighted out of their wits at seeing such an appearance
coming towards their island. Such of the forces as landed
enquired at the inhabitants they met with about the young
Pretender. The poor creatures were quite amazed, and
declared they knew nothing of that man, for they had never
[<em>fol.</em> 280.]
heard of him before. They said they had heard a report that
their Laird, MacLeod, had lately had war with a great woman
abroad, but that he had got the better of her, and that was
all they knew of the disturbances in the world. Upon this the
General and his command (not a small one) returned with
their finger in their cheek, when in the meantime they thought
they had been sure to catch the much-coveted price of
blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April</div>

<p>When Donald MacLeod had absolutely refused to go any
message whatsomever to Sir Alexander MacDonald and the
Laird of MacLeod, the Prince said to him. 'I hear, Donald,
you are a good pilot; that you know all this coast well, and
therefore I hope you can carry me safely through the islands
where I may look for more safety than I can do here.' Donald
answered he would do anything in the world for him; he
would run any risque except only that which he had formerly
mentioned; and that he most willingly undertook to do his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
best in the service he now proposed. For this purpose Donald
procured a stout eight-oar'd boat, the property of John MacDonald,
son of Æneas or Angus Mac-Donald of Boradale.
Both Donald MacLeod and Malcolm MacLeod said that this
John MacDonald was either killed at the battle of Culloden
[<em>fol.</em> 281.]
or butchered next day in cold blood (which was the fate of
many), for that he had never been heard of since that time.
Donald took care to buy a pot for boyling pottage or the like
when they should happen to come to land, and a poor firlot of
meal was all the provision he could make out to take with
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26 April</div>

<p>April 26th. They go on board in the twilight of the evening
in Lochnannua, at Boradale, being the very spot of ground
where the Prince landed at first upon the continent; and
Boradale's house was the first roof he was under when he
arrived upon the continent. There were in the boat the
Prince, Captain O'Sullivan, Captain O'Neil, Allan MacDonald,
commonly called Captain MacDonald (of the family of Clanranald),
and a clergyman of the Church of Rome; and Donald
MacLeod for pilot managing the helm, and betwixt whose feet
the Prince took his seat. The names of the boatmen are:
Rhoderick MacDonald, Lauchlan MacMurrich, Rhoderick
MacCaskgill, John MacDonald, Murdoch MacLeod (son of
the pilot), Duncan Roy, Alexander MacDonald, and Edward
Bourk or Burk, a common chairman in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The above Murdoch MacLeod was then a lad only of 15
years of age, a scholar in the Grammar School of Inverness.
When he heard of the appearance of a battle, having got himself
[<em>fol.</em> 282.]
provided in a claymore, durk, and pistol, he ran off from
the school, and took his chance in the field of Culloden battle.
After the defeat he found means to trace out the road the
Prince had taken, and followed him from place to place; 'and
this was the way,' said Donald, 'that I met wi' my poor boy.'</p>

<p>As to Ned Bourk, I asked if Bourk was not an Irish name,
and where Ned was born. Both Donald and Malcolm joined
in saying that Bourk indeed was originally an Irish name, but
that there had been some of that name for three or four
generations past in and about the Isle of Sky, where, or rather
in North Uist, Ned was born. They likewise told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Ned from the beginning of the expedition had been servant
to Mr. Alexander MacLeod (son of Mr. John MacLeod, Advocate),
one of the Prince's aid-de-camps; that Ned knew all
Scotland well, and a great part of England, having been
servant to several gentlemen; and that he was <em>the man</em> that
led the Prince off the field of battle, and guided him all the
way to Boradale. They spoke excellent things of poor Ned;
and James MacDonald, the landlord, supported them in what
they said, for he knows Ned very well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27 April</div>

<p>When the Prince and his small retinue were thinking of
going on board the eight-oar'd boat, Donald MacLeod begged
[<em>fol.</em> 283.]
the Prince not to set out that night, for that it would
certainly be a storm, and he could not think of his exposing
himself. The Prince asked how Donald came to think it
would be a storm. 'Why, sir,' said Donald, 'I see it coming
already.' However, the Prince, anxious to be out of the continent
where parties were then dispersed in search of him, was
positive to set out directly without loss of time. They had
not rowed far from the shore till a most violent tempest arose,
greater than any Donald MacLeod had ever been trysted with
before, though all his lifetime a seafaring man, upon the coast
of Scotland. To this they had the additional distress of
thunder and lightning and a heavy pour-down of rain, which
continued all the time they were at sea. When the Prince
saw the storm increasing still more and more he wanted much
to be at land again, and desired Donald to steer directly for
the rock, which runs no less than three miles along one side of
the loch. 'For,' said the Prince, 'I had rather face canons
and muskets than be in such a storm as this.' But Donald
would not hear of that proposal at all, assuring the Prince
that it was impossible for them to return to the land again,
because the squall was against them, and that if they should
steer for the rock the boat would undoubtedly stave to pieces
and all of them behoved to be drowned, for there was no
[<em>fol.</em> 284.]
possibility of saving any one life amongst them upon such a
dangerous rock, where the sea was dashing with the utmost
violence. The Prince then asked Donald what he had a mind
to do. 'Why,' replied Donald, 'since we are here we have
nothing for it, but, under God, to set out to sea directly. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it not as good for us to be drown'd in clean water as to be
dashed in pieces upon a rock and to be drowned too?'</p>

<p>After this all was hush and silence; not one word more
amongst them, expecting every moment to be overwhelmed
with the violence of the waves, and to sink down to the bottom.
To make the case still worse they had neither pump nor compass
nor lantern with them, and the night turned so pitch
dark that they knew not where they were for the most of the
course. This made them afraid of being tossed upon some
coast (such as the Isle of Sky) where the militia were in arms to
prevent the Prince's escape. 'But,' to use Donald's words, 'as
God would have it, by peep of day we discovered ourselves to
be on the coast of the Long Isle, and we made directly to the
nearest land, which was Rushness in the Island Benbecula.
With great difficulty we got on shore, and saved the boat,
hawling her up to dry land, in the morning of April 27th.</p>

<p>I asked how long the course might be that they made in the
violent storm. Donald declared that they had run at least
[<em>fol.</em> 285.]
thirty-two leagues in eight hours. About this Malcom MacLeod
made some doubt, alleging the course not to be so long,
and they reasoned the matter betwixt them. James MacDonald
supported Donald in what he had advanced, and after
some debate Malcolm acknowledged that Donald was in the
right, and that the course they had been driven was rather
more than thirty-two leagues. The storm lasted 4 hours
after landing.</p>

<p>Then I asked Donald if the Prince was in health all the
time he was with him. Donald said that the Prince would
never own he was in bad health, though he and all that were
with him had reason to think that during the whole time the
Prince was more or less under a bloody flux; but that he bore
up most surprizingly, and never wanted spirits. Donald added,
that the Prince, for all the fatigue he underwent, never slept
above three or four hours at most at a time, and that when he
awaked in the morning he was always sure to call for a chopin
of water, which he never failed to drink off at a draught; and
that he had a little bottle in his poutch out of which he used
to take so many drops every morning and throughout the day,
saying if anything should ail him he hoped he should cure himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for that he was something of a doctor. 'And faith,' said
Donald, 'he was indeed a bit of a doctor, for Ned Bourk
happening ance to be unco ill of a cholick, the Prince said,
'Let him alane, I hope to cure him of that,' and accordingly
[<em>fol.</em> 286.]
he did so, for he gae him sae mony draps out o' the little
bottlie and Ned soon was as well as ever he had been.'</p>

<p>When they landed at Rushness in Benbecula, they came to
an uninhabited hut where they made a fire to dry their cloaths,
for all of them were wet through and through in to the skin,
and an old sail was spread upon the bare ground, which served
for a bed to the Prince, who was very well pleased with it, and
slept soundly. Here they kill'd a cow, and the pot which
Donald had brought served them in good stead for boyling
bits of the beef. In this poor hut they remained two days and
two nights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29 April</div>

<div class="sidenote">30 April</div>

<p>April 29th. In the evening they set sail from Benbecula on
board the same eight-oar'd boat for the island Scalpay, commonly
called the Island Glass, where they landed safely about
two hours before daylight next day, the Prince and O'Sullivan
going under the name of Sinclair, the latter passing for the
father, and the former for the son. Betwixt Benbecula and
Scalpay there is the distance of thirteen or fifteen leagues. In
this island Donald MacLeod had an acquaintance, Donald
Campbell, to whose house he brought the Prince and his
small retinue before break of day, April 30th. Being all
cold and hungry, Donald MacLeod desired immediately to
have a good fire, which was instantly got for them. Donald
MacLeod was here only one night, but the Prince remained
four nights, and was most kindly entertained by his hospitable
landlord, Donald Campbell, whose civility and compassion the
Prince entertained a most grateful sense of.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1 May</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 287.]
May 1st. Donald MacLeod was dispatched by the Prince to
Stornway in the island of Lewis in order to hire a vessel
under a pretence of sailing to the Orkneys to take in meal for
the Isle of Sky, as Donald used to deal in that way formerly.
Here Donald once more affirmed that O'Neil did not go with
him to Stornway, and desired me to remark his assertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
accordingly. Donald left the eight-oar'd boat at Scalpay, and
got another boat from his friend, Mr. Campbell, in which he
sailed for Stornway, where he remained some time without
making out the design on which he was sent. But at last he
succeeded, and then dispatched an express to the Prince in
Scalpay (between which and Stornway thirty miles by land)
to inform him that he had got a vessel to his mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 May</div>

<p>May 4th. The Prince (leaving Allan MacDonald, the Popish
clergyman in Scalpay, who afterwards returned to South Uist),
set out on foot for Stornoway, attended by O'Sullivan and
O'Neil, taking a guide along to direct them the right road.
This guide, in going to the Harris (between which and Scalpay
there is a ferry of only a quarter of a mile) took them eight
miles out of the way. In coming from Harris to the Lewis
they fell under night, and a very stormy and rainy night it
was, which fatigued them very much, their journey, by the
mistake of their guide, being no less than thirty-eight long
Highland miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 May</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 288.] May 5th. When in sight of Stornway the Prince sent the
guide to Donald MacLeod to inform him that he and the
two captains were at such a place, desiring withal that he
would forthwith send them a bottle of brandy and some bread
and cheese, for that they stood much in need of a little refreshment.
Donald immediately obeyed the summons and came to
the Prince, bringing along with him the demanded provisions.
He found the Prince and his two attendants upon a muir all
wet to the skin, and wearied enough with such a long journey
through the worst of roads in the world. Donald told the
Prince that he knew of a faithful and true friend to take care
of him till things should be got ready for the intended voyage.
This was the Lady Killdun<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> at Arynish, to whose house Donald
conducted the Prince and his two attendants. Here the Prince
was obliged to throw off his shirt, which one of the company
did wring upon the hearth-stone, and did spread it upon a
chair before the fire to have it dried.</p>

<p>The same day, May 5th, Donald was sent back to Stornway
to get things in readiness. But when he came there, to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
great surprize he found no less than two or three hundred men
in arms. The Lewis is inhabited by the MacKenzies, and belongs
to the Earl of Seaforth. Donald could not understand
[<em>fol.</em> 289.]
at all what was the matter that occasioned such a sudden
rising of men, and therefore, without fear or dread, he went
directly into the room where the gentlemen were that had
taken upon themselves the rank of officers, and asked them
what was the matter. Every one of them immediately cursed
him bitterly, and gave him very abusive language, affirming
that he had brought this plague upon them; for that they
were well assured the Prince was already upon the Lewis, and
not far from Stornway, with five hundred men. This they
said exposed them to the hazard of losing both their cattle
and their lives, as they heard the Prince was come with a full
resolution to force a vessel from Stornway. Donald very
gravely asked, How sorrow such a notion could ever enter into
their heads? 'Where, I pray you,' said he, 'could the Prince
in his present condition get 500 or one hundred men together?
I believe the men are mad. Has the devil possessed you
altogether?' They replied that Mr. John MacAulay, Presbyterian
preacher in South Uist, had writ these accounts to his
[<em>fol.</em> 290.]
father in the Harris, and that the said father had transmitted
the same to Mr. Colin MacKenzie, Presbyterian teacher in the
Lewis. Donald saned these blades, the informers, very heartily,
and spared not to give them their proper epithets in strong
terms. 'Well then,' said Donald, 'since you know already that
the Prince is upon your island, I acknowledge the truth of it;
but then he is so far from having any number of men with him
that he has only but two companions with him, and when I
am there I make the third. And yet let me tell you farther,
gentlemen, if Seaforth himself were here, by G&mdash;&mdash; he durst
not put a hand to the Prince's breast.'</p>

<p>Here Donald desired me to remark particularly for the
honour of the honest MacKenzies in the Lewis (notwithstanding
the vile abusive language they had given him) that they declared
they had no intention to do the Prince the smallest hurt,
or to meddle with him at present in any shape. But then
they were mighty desirous he might leave them and go to the
continent, or anywhere else he should think convenient. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
wind being quite fair for the continent Donald desired they
would give him a pilot, but they absolutely refused to give
him one. Donald offered any money for one, but he said he
believed he would not have got one though he should have
offered £500 sterling, such was the terror and dread the people
[<em>fol.</em> 291.]
were struck with. Donald then returned to the Prince and
gave him an honest account how matters stood, which made
them all at a loss to know what course to take, all choices
having but a bad aspect.</p>

<p>At this time the Prince, O'Sullivan and O'Neill had but six
shirts amongst them, and frequently when they stript to dry
those that were upon them they found those that they were to
put on as wet as the ones they had thrown off.</p>

<p>In this great difficulty the Prince declared, let the consequence
be what it would, he could not think of stirring anywhere
that night till he should sleep a little, so much was he
fatigued with the late tedious journey. And the two captains
were no less wearied, being quite undone. To make their case
still worse, two of the boatmen had run away from Stornway,
being frighted out of their wits at the rising of the men in arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6 May</div>

<p>May 6th. About eight o'clock in the morning the Prince,
O'Sullivan, O'Neil, Donald MacLeod and the six boatmen
(two whereof were Donald's own son and honest Ned Bourk),
went on board Donald Campbell's boat, which they had got at
Scalpa, and sailed for the Island Euirn, twelve miles from
[<em>fol.</em> 292.]
Stornway, and landed safely. This Euirn is a desert island
round which the people of the Lewis use to go a fishing, and
upon which they frequently land to spread their fish upon the
rocks of it for drying. The fishermen were then at Stornway,
but not one of them could be prevailed upon to accompany the
Prince to the uninhabited island, for the wind was contrary,
and it blew a very hard gale.</p>

<p>When they were in Lady Killdun's house they had killed a
cow, for which the Prince desired payment to be made; but
the landlady refused to accept of it. However, Donald said,
before they left the house he obliged her to take the price of
the cow. 'For,' said Donald, 'so long as there was any money
among us, I was positive that the deel a man or woman should
have it to say that the Prince ate their meat for nought.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
They took the head and some pieces of the cow along with
them in the boat, as also two pecks of meal and plenty of
brandy and sugar. They had all along a wooden plate for
making their dough for bread, and they made use of stones for
birsling their bannocks before the fire. When they were parting
with Lady Killdun she called Ned Bourk aside and (as
Donald said) gave him a junt of butter betwixt two fardles of
[<em>fol.</em> 293.]
bread, which Ned put into a wallet they had for carrying some
little baggage.</p>

<p>Upon the desart island they found plenty of good dry fish,
of which they were resolved to make the best fare they could
without any butter, not knowing of the junt that Ned had in
his wallet. As they had plenty of brandy and sugar along
with them, and found very good springs upon the island, they
wanted much to have a little warm punch to chear their hearts
in this cold remote place. They luckily found a earthen
pitcher which the fishers had left upon the island, and this
served their purpose very well for heating the punch. But the
second night the pitcher by some accident or another was
broke to pieces, so that they could have no more warm punch.</p>

<p>When Donald was asked if ever the Prince used to give any
particular toast when they were taking a cup of cold water,
whiskie, or the like, he said that the Prince very often drank to
the Black Eye, 'by which,' said Donald, 'he meant the second
daughter of France; and I never heard him name any particular
health but that alone.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> When he spoke of that lady, which he
did frequently, he appeared to be more than ordinary well
pleased.' When Donald was asked if ever he heard the Prince
mention that he had any trust to put in the King of France
[<em>fol.</em> 294.]
for assistance, he answered that the Prince when he spoke of
the King of France mentioned him with great affection, and
declared that he firmly believed the King of France had his
cause much at heart, and would (he hoped) do all in his power
to promote it. When the Prince at any time was talking
upon this subject, Donald said he used to add these words:
'But, gentlemen, I can assure you, a King and his Council are
two very different things.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>Ned Bourk stood cook and baxter; but Donald said, the
Prince was the best cook of them all. One day upon the
desart island the Prince and Ned were employed in making
out a dish of fish, while all the rest were asleep. Ned, not
minding that he had the junt of butter, began to complain
that the fish would make but a very sarless morsel without
butter. The Prince said the fish would do very well in their
present condition, and that they behoved to take the fish till
the butter should come. Ned, at last reflecting, told the
Prince that he had got a junt of butter from Lady Killdun,
which he laid up betwixt two fardles of bread in the wallet,
which was then lying in the boat. The Prince said that would
do exceedingly well, for it would serve to compleat their
cookery, and desired Ned to go fetch it immediately. When
Ned came to take out the butter the bread was all crumbled
into pieces, so that it made a very ugly appearance. Ned
[<em>fol.</em> 295.]
returned and told the Prince the butter would not serve the
purpose at all, for that it was far from being clean, the bread
being crumbled into pieces and wrought in amongst it, and
therefore he thought shame to present it. 'What,' said the
Prince, 'was not the butter clean when it was put there?'
'Yes,' answered Ned, 'it was clean enough.' 'Then,' replied
the Prince, 'you are a child, Ned. The butter will do exceedingly
well. The bread can never file it. Go, fetch it immediately.'
When the fish were sufficiently boyled they awakened
the rest of the company to share in the entertainment.
Donald MacLeod, looking at the butter, said the deel a drap
of that butter he would take, for it was neither good nor
clean. But the Prince told him he was very nice indeed, for
that the butter would serve the turn very well at present, and
he caused it to be served up. They made a very hearty meal
of the fish and the crumbs of bread swimming among the
butter.</p>

<p>At another time, when Ned was preparing to bake some
bannocks, the Prince said he would have a cake of his own
contriving, which was to take the brains of the cow and mingle
them well in amongst the meal, when making the dough, and
this he said they would find to be very wholesome meat. His
directions were obeyed, and, said Donald, 'he gave orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 296.]
birsle the bannock well, or else it would not do at all.' When
the cake was fully fired the Prince divided it into so many
pieces, giving every gentleman a bit of it; and Donald said,
'it made very good bread indeed.'</p>

<p>Here I asked if the boatmen did eat in common with the
Prince and the gentlemen? 'Na, good faith, they!' said
Donald, 'set them up wi' that indeed, the fallows! to eat wi'
the Prince and the shentlemen! We even kept up the port of
the Prince upon the desart island itself and kept twa tables,
one for the Prince and the shentlemen, and the other for the
boatmen. We sat upon the bare ground, having a big stone
in the middle of us for a table, and sometimes we ate off our
knee or the bare ground as it happened.'</p>

<p>Upon this uninhabited island they remained four days and
four nights in a low, pityful hut, which the fishers had made
up for themselves; but it was so ill-roofed that they were
obliged to spread the sail of the boat over the top of it.
They found heath and turf enough to make a fire of; but had
nothing but the bare ground to lie along upon when disposed
to take a nap, without any covering upon them at all.</p>

<p>When they were consulting about taking their departure
from this barren island, the Prince ordered two dozen of the
fish to be put on board the boat whatever might happen to
[<em>fol.</em> 297.]
them, and said he would leave money for them, placing the
cash upon a fish, that so the people, when they missed of the
number of their fish might find the value of what they wanted.
But O'Sullivan or O'Neil told him it was needless to leave any
money, lest vagrants should happen to land upon the island
and take the money which did not belong to them. These
two prevailed upon him to allow the money to be taken up
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10 May</div>

<p>May 10th. They set sail from the uninhabited island, when
the Prince told his retinue he was determined to return to
Scalpay or the Island Glass, in order to pay his respects to
honest Donald Campbell for the remarkable civilities he had
shown him; and then he ordered to steer the course directly
to that island. When they arrived at Scalpay, Donald Campbell
was not at home, having gone a skulking for fear of being
laid up, an account or rumour having passed from hand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hand that the Prince had been in his house, and that the
landlord had entertained him kindly. The Prince was sorry
at missing his hospitable friend, and set sail directly from
Scalpa the same day, May 10th. Here Donald said the Prince
would not part with Campbell's boat, because it was such a
fine, light, swift-sailing thing. In coursing along they happened
to spy a ship at Finisbery, in the Harris, within two
musket-shot, before they observed her. They were on the
windward of the ship at the mouth of the said bay, and made
[<em>fol.</em> 298.]
all the haste they could along the coast to Benbicula. In this
course they spied another ship in Lochmaddy, in North Uist,
which occasioned them to make all the sail and rowing they
could to get free of the mouth of the loch and out of sight of
the ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11 May</div>

<p>May 11th. Being still upon the sea they fell short of bread;
but having some meal on board and the men turning very
hungry and thirsty, they began to make Dramach (in Erse
<em>Stappack</em>) with salt water, and to lick it up. The Prince said
that was a kind of meat he had never seen before, and therefore
he behoved to try it how it would go down. Donald said
the Prince ate of it very heartily, and much more than he
could do for his life. Never any meat or drink came wrong to
him, for he could take a share of every thing, be it good, bad,
or indifferent, and was always chearful and contented in every
condition.</p>

<p>May 11th. They arrived at Lochwiskaway, in Benbicula,
and had scarce got ashore when the wind proved quite contrary
to what it had been, blowing a hard gale, which served
to make the ships they had spied steer an opposite course. A
heavy rain likewise came on at the same time. It happened
then to be low water; and one of the boatmen went in among
the rocks where he catched a large partan, and taking it up in
his hand he wagged it at the Prince, who was at some distance
from him. The Prince then took up a cog in his hand, and
running towards the lad desired to share in his game.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 301.] dispatched Donald MacLeod in Campbell's boat to the continent
with letters to Lochiel and John Murray of Broughton,
in order to know how affairs stood, and that Donald might
bring along with him some cash and brandy. Donald met
with Lochiel and Murray at the head of Locharkaig; but got
no money at all from Murray, who said he had none to give,
having only about sixty louis d'ores to himself, which was not
worth the while to send. Donald received letters from Lochiel
and Murray to the Prince, and found means without much ado
to purchase two anchors of brandy at a guinea per anchor.
Here Donald observed that the Prince had a very good opinion
of Murray, looking upon him as one of the honestest, firmest
men in the whole world.</p>

<p>Donald was absent from the Prince eighteen days or thereabouts,
and upon his return he found the Prince where he left
him upon Coradale. During his abode on this mountain he
lived in a tenant's house, only a hut better than ordinary,
diverting and maintaining himself with hunting and fishing;
for he used frequently to go down to the foot of the hill upon
the shore, and there go on board a small boat, which continued
rowing along, and he catched with hand-lines fishes called lyths,
somewhat like young cod.</p>

<div class="sidenote">14 June</div>

<div class="sidenote">15 June</div>

<p>June 14th. From the foot of Coradale they set sail in
[<em>fol.</em> 302.]
Campbell's boat still towards Loch Boisdale, but spying three
sail within canon-shot of the shore about break of day, this
obliged them to put back to a place called Cilistiela in South
Uist.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Next morning, June 15th, once more they set sail for
Loch Boisdale, where they arrived safely. Here they got
accounts that Boisdale was made a prisoner, which was a thing
not looked for at all, as he had all along lived peaceably at
home, and had kept back all Clanranald's men upon the Isles
from following their young chiftain. These accounts of
Boisdale's being a prisoner distressed the Prince and his small
retinue exceedingly much, as Boisdale was the person principally
concerned in the preservation of the Prince; and all along
had been most careful to consult the safety of the Prince in
his dangers upon and about the Isles. Malcolm MacLeod and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Donald MacLeod both agreed in affirming that had not
Boisdale been made a prisoner the Prince needed not to have
left the Long Isle for all the searches (and very strict ones they
were) that were made after him by the troops and militia; so
well did Boisdale know all the different places of concealment
throughout the Long Isle that were fittest for the Prince to be
in, and so exact he was in sending timeous notice to the Prince
by proper hands, if he could not with safety wait upon him in
person, to be here or there, in this or the other place, at such
and such times as he thought convenient to point out to him.
Boisdale's confinement therefore behoved to be an inexpressible
[<em>fol.</em> 303.]
hardship and distress upon the Prince, and make him quite at
a loss what to do or what corner to turn himself to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24 June</div>

<p>Lady Boisdale sent four bottles of brandy to the Prince, and
every other thing she could procure that was useful for him
and his attendants. In and about Loch Boisdale the Prince
continued for eight or ten days, till June 24th, that the woeful
parting behoved to ensue betwixt the Prince and Donald MacLeod,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>One day coursing up and down upon Loch Boisdale Donald
MacLeod asked the Prince if he were once come to his own
what he would do with Sir Alexander MacDonald and the
Laird of MacLeod for their behaviour. 'O Donald,' said the
Prince, 'what would you have me to do with them? Are
they not our own people still, let them do what they will? It
is not their fault for what they have done. It is altogether
owing to the power that President Forbes had over their judgment
in these matters. Besides, if the king were restored, we
would be as sure of them for friends as any other men whatsomever.'
The Prince blamed the young Laird of MacLeod
much more than the father; for that, he said, the son had been
introduced to him in France, where he kissed his hands, and
solemnly promised him all the service that lay in his power to
promote his cause; but that when put to the trial he did not
keep to his engagements at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 Aug.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 304.] Here Malcolm MacLeod remarked that the Prince spoke
likewise to him about the Laird of MacLeod and his son; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
he said when the Prince was talking about them, he could not
fail observing with what wariness and caution the Prince
(knowing he was talking to a MacLeod) ordered his words, not
being sure likewise in his then circumstances whom to trust, or
how easily people might be offended at any observations he
might happen to make upon those who had not dealt so fairly
by him.</p>

<p>Both Donald and Malcolm agreed in giving it as their
opinion that the Prince had an excess of mercy and goodness
about him at all times.</p>

<p>They likewise agreed in saying they had good reason to
believe that honest Hugh MacDonald of Armadale in Sky
(stepfather of Miss MacDonald) had a meeting with the Prince
at Rushness in Benbecula, that he got the Prince's pistols in
keeping, and that he had them still in his custody.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> They
added further, they were persuaded he would sooner part with
his life than with these pistols, unless they were to be given to
the proper owner; and that he was the grand contriver in
laying and executing the scheme for the Prince's escape in
women's cloaths from the Long Isle to the Isle of Sky. They
said they had often heard that Armadale sent a letter by Miss
Flora to his wife, wherein he used some such expression as this,
'that he had found out an Irish girl, Bettie Bourk, very fit for
[<em>fol.</em> 305.]
being a servant to her, and that among her other good qualifications
she had this one, that <em>well could she spin</em>, which, he
knew, she liked well.'<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>They also agreed in telling me that the whole Island of
Raaza had been plundered and pillaged to the utmost degree
of severity, every house and hut being levelled with the ground;
and there was not left in the whole island a four-footed beast,
a hen or a chicken.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> As there is plenty of free stone and
marble in Raaza, the Laird had built of these materials a very
neat genteel house for himself, which was razed out at the
foundation. But in destroying it they had carefully preserved
the windows (all of oak), and put them on board of a ship of
war for sale. When the ship came to the Road of Leith,
James MacDonald, joiner, and a kinsman of Raaza's, went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
board, and bought the windows, which were all done with
crown glass, chusing rather they should fall into his hands than
into those of any indifferent person, because he could account
for them to the owner when a proper opportunity should offer.
I saw the windows in James MacDonald's house.</p>

<p>Donald MacLeod said the Prince used to smoak a great deal
of tobacco; and as in his wanderings from place to place the
pipes behoved to break and turn into short cutties, he used to
take quills, and putting one into another, and all, said Donald,
[<em>fol.</em> 306.]
'into the end of the cuttie, this served to make it long enough,
and the tobacco to smoak cool.' Donald added that he never
knew, in all his life, any one better at finding out a shift than
the Prince was when he happened to be at a pinch; and that
the Prince would sometimes sing them a song to keep up their
hearts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746
24 June</div>

<p>They expected that Boisdale would get free at Barra. But
one came and told the Prince (to his great sorrow) that Boisdale
was still to be detained a prisoner, and that there was no
appearance of his being set at liberty. This, with other distresses
that were still increasing upon him, made the Prince
resolve upon parting from his attendants for the greater safety.
There were at that time two ships of war in the mouth of Loch
Boisdale, for whom they durst not make out of the loch to the
sea. Besides there was a command of above five hundred red-coats
and militia within a mile and a half of them. All choices
were bad, but (under God) they behoved to remove from the
place where they then were, and to do their best.</p>

<p>The Prince called for the boatmen, and ordered O'Sullivan
to pay every one of them a shilling sterling a day, besides their
maintenance. He gave a draught of sixty pistols to Donald
MacLeod to be paid by Mr. John Hay of Restalrig, if he should
happen to be so lucky as to meet with him upon the continent.
[<em>fol.</em> 307.]
But as Donald never met with Mr. Hay the draught remains
yet unpaid. Donald could not help saying here that he did
not despair of the payment, for that he hoped for (as old as he
was) to see the draught paid to him with interest.</p>

<p>When Donald came to talk of the parting he grat sare and
said, It was a woeful parting indeed, but still insists that he
hopes to see him yet 'for a' that's come and gane.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">24 June</div>

<p>June 24th. They parted with a resolution to meet again at
a certain place by different roads; Donald MacLeod, O'Sullivan,
and the boatmen walking away and leaving O'Neil only with
the Prince. Donald MacLeod went south about, but all the
men left him, one only excepted; upon which he was obliged
to sink the boat, and to do the best he could to shift for
himself. But it was not possible for an old man like him to
keep himself any considerable time out of grips, especially as
the troops and militia at last became so very numerous upon
the different parts of the Long Isle. The militia were the
worst of all, because they knew the country so well. Donald
and Malcolm MacLeod were positive that the red-coats could
have done but little, particularly in taking those that were
[<em>fol.</em> 308.]
skulking, had it not been for the militia, viz., Campbells,
Monroes, Grants, etc., etc., who served to scour the hills and
woods, and were as so many guides for the red-coats to discover
to them the several corners of the country, both upon the
continent and on the islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 July</div>

<p>July 5th. Donald MacLeod had the misfortune to be taken
prisoner in Benbecula by Allan MacDonald of Knock, in Slate
in Sky, a lieutenant. The same day Mr. Allan MacDonald,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
of the family of Glenaladale, and Mr. Forrest, clergyman of
the Church of Rome, were made prisoners by the said Knock,
but not at the same time of day nor upon the same spot with
Donald MacLeod. Mr. MacDonald, one of the clergymen,
commonly called Captain MacDonald, had sixty guineas in his
pocket, which Knock took from him, though he was his blood
relation, and would not give him one single shilling to purchase
necessaries with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<p>From Benbecula the two priests and honest Donald were
brought to Barra, in order (as was given out) to appear before
General Campbell; but they did not see him there. From
Barra they were carried to Loch Brachandale in Sky, and from
Loch Brachandale to Portree in Sky, where Donald had the
mortification of being neglected and disregarded by some of his
own relations, who saw him, but soon turned their backs upon
him, and would not vouchsafe to speak one word to him. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 309.]
affected Donald's honest heart very much. 'But,' said Donald,
'the rogues will be fain to speak to me now when I go back to
Sky, where indeed I thought never to return any more. But I
shall make them understand themselves.'</p>

<p>At Portree Donald MacLeod and Malcolm MacLeod met as
fellow-prisoners, and from that were carried to Applecross Bay
towards the continent, and there they were put on board the
sloop commanded by the noted John Ferguson so often mentioned.
Donald MacLeod was immediately brought into the
cabin before General Campbell, who examined him most exactly
and circumstantially. The General asked if he had been along
with the young Pretender? 'Yes,' said Donald, 'I was along
with that young gentleman, and I winna deny it.' 'Do you
know,' said the General, 'what money was upon that man's
head? no less a sum than <em>thirty thousand pounds sterling</em>, which
would have made you and all your children after you happy
for ever.' Donald's answer to this is so very good that the
beauty of it would be quite spoil'd if I did not give it in his
own words, which are these. 'What then? <em>thirty thousand
pounds!</em> Though I had gotten't I could not have enjoyed it
eight and forty hours. Conscience would have gotten up upon
me. That money could not have kept it down. And tho' I
could have gotten all England and Scotland for my pains I
would not allowed a hair of his body to be touch'd if I could
[<em>fol.</em> 310.]
help it.' Here Donald desired me particularly to remark for
the honour of General Campbell, and to do him justice, that
he spoke these words, 'I will not say that you are in the wrong.'
Then the General said, 'But now you are in the king's mercy,
and if you will not declare every thing you know of this matter,
here is a machine (pointing to it) that will force you to declare.'
Donald replied that 'Many a prettier fellow than he was now
in his mercy, and that he would tell anything he knew without
any machine whatsoever.' This was Boisdale's machine in
which he used to torture thieves to make them confess.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Such particular questions were then asked that Donald
behoved to give an account of the violent storm they were
engaged in when sailing from the continent to the Isles, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
persons were on board at that time and what their characters
were. When the General heard of a Popish priest in the case
he asked, Seeing it was a very tempestuous night they set out in
from the continent, whether or not the priest was not very busy
in praying heartily for the young Pretender, as he was in danger
of drowning? 'Na, good faith he, Sir,' replied Donald, 'for if
he prayed for himsell, he thought he did well enough. And
had you been there, Sir, you would have thought you did well
enough too if you prayed for yoursell. Every one of us was
minding himsell then.' Then a written declaration was taken
from Donald's own mouth and he subscribed it.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 311.]
Donald said he could easily give all his own part of the
adventure without doing the smallest harm to the Prince as he
then knew that the Prince had set out some time before from
Sky to the Continent, and was out of the reach of General
Campbell and his command.</p>

<p>Here Malcolm MacLeod informed me that he likewise gave
a written declaration, but did not subscribe it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April</div>

<p>They both concurred in affirming the Ferguson behaved very
roughly and barbarously to them. When they were in health
they and the other prisoners were brought upon the quarter-deck
betwixt 9 and 10 in the morning, and were allowed to
walk among two dozen or so of sheep with sentries placed on
each side of them. So long as Ferguson was cruizing upon the
Highland coast he took care to have great plenty of fresh
victuals of all sorts, the sweet fruits of plundering and pillaging.
The prisoners got only half-mans allowance in every respect. For
one day of the week they had pease; but the common fellows
of the ship behoved to be served first before the gentlemen got
any at all; and if the pease happened to fall short, the fellows
would have mixed them up with salt-water. The victuals were
brought to the prisoners in foul nasty buckets, wherein the
fellows used to piss for a piece of ill-natured diversion. They
were assigned their quarters in a dark place of the ship, where
[<em>fol.</em> 312.]
they were not allowed the light of a candle of any kind, 'from
the 1st of August 1746 to the day,' said Donald and Malcolm,
'upon which Lord Lovat suffered, being April 9th (Thursday)
1747. When they were brought opposite to Tilbury Fort upon
the Thames, they were turned over from Ferguson to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ship, where they lay for months together in a most deplorable
state of misery, their cloaths wearing so off them that many at
last had not a single rag to cover their nakedness with. Here
they were treated with the utmost barbarity and cruelty, with
a view (as they suppose) to pine away their lives, and by piecemeal
to destroy every single man of them. And indeed the
design had too great success, for many of them died. Donald
MacLeod said he had reason to think that no less than four
hundred men died on board three ships opposite to Tilbury
Fort,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> among which sixty or seventy Grants of Glenmoriston,
who by the persuasion of the laird of Grant had surrendred
themselves and delivered up their arms at Inverness, when
Cumberland was there not long after the battle of Culloden.
Donald and Malcolm declared that finer and stouter men never
drew a sword then what these Glenmoriston men were; and
none of them survived the miserable situation and returned to
their own country, but only one or two. They likewise joined
in laying great blame to the door of the Laird of Grant, who,
[<em>fol.</em> 313.]
they said, could not fail to know what would turn out to be the
fate of those men if they should be prevailed upon to surrender.
In a word they looked upon him as the instrument of the
misery of these brave fellows, and spoke no good things of him
at all, affirming that he entertained a hatred at the Grants of
Glenmoriston.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Here Donald and Malcolm had a remark very much to the
purpose. They said, It was most lucky that a greater number
had not surrendered at the same time, for that the treatment of
the Glenmoriston men became a warning to others not to follow
their example. And indeed their fate did prevent many
surrendries that otherwise would have happened.</p>

<p>Donald MacLeod affirmed that they lived at least for two
days upon horse flesh. Here Malcolm did not fully agree with
him, and after some little debate betwixt them Malcolm
qualified the expression and told me I might write down that
the beef they got was so very bad and black that they could
not take it for anything else but horse flesh or carrion. Upon
this Donald smiled and said, 'Well, Malcolm, how much have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
you mended the matter?' When Donald was asked how such
beef went down with them, he replied, 'O what is it that will
not go down wi' a hungry stomack? I can assure you we made
no scruple to eat anything that came in our way.'</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 314.]
Almost all those that were in the same ship with Donald and
Malcolm were once so sick that they could scarce stretch out
their hands to one another. Old MacKinnon, one of their companions,
held out wonderfully, although a man upwards of 70.
He was only about eight days in such a way that he needed one
to help him up in the morning; while others much younger,
and to all appearances stronger too, were dying by pairs, as at
last there was a general sickness that raged among all the
prisoners on board the different ships, which could not fail to
be the case when (as both Donald and Malcolm positively
affirmed) they were sometimes fed with the beeves that had
died of the disease which was then raging amongst the horned
cattle in England.</p>

<p>When Donald and Malcolm were talking of the barbarous
usage they themselves and others met with, they used to say,
'God forgie them; but God lat them never die till we have
them in the same condition they had us, and we are sure we
would not treat them as they treated us. We would show them
the difference between a good and a bad cause.'</p>

<p>Donald MacLeod spoke very much good of Mr. James
Falconar, a Scots non-jurant clergyman, and Charles Allan,
son of Hary Allan in Leith. He said that Charles Allan
behaved exceedingly well in his distress, and had very much of
[<em>fol.</em> 315.]
the gentleman about him, and that he was in a state of sickness
for some time. He said that Mr. Falconar was scarce
ever any way ill in his health, that he bore up better than any
one of them, having a great fund of spirits, being always chearful,
and never wanting something to say to divert them in their
state of darkness and misery. He added that he did not know a
better man, or one of greater courage and resolution in distress.</p>

<p>Donald desired me to take notice that he was set at liberty
(out of a messenger's house in London, where he had been but
a short time) upon a most happy day, the 10th of June 1747.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<p>Donald has got in a present a large silver snuff-box prettily
chessed, from his good friend, Mr. John Walkingshaw of London,
which serves as an excellent medal of his history, as it has
engraven upon it the interesting adventure, with proper
mottos, etc. The box is an octagon oval of three inches and
three quarters in length, three inches in breadth, and an inch
and a quarter in depth, and the inside of it is doubly gilt.
Upon the lid is raised the eight-oar'd boat, with Donald at
the helm, and the four under his care, together with the eight
rowers distinctly represented. The sea is made to appear very
[<em>fol.</em> 316.]
rough and tempestuous. Upon one of the extremities of the
lid there is a landskip of the Long Isle, and the boat is just
steering into Rushness, the point of Benbicula where they
landed. Upon the other extremity of the lid there is a landskip
of the end of the Isle of Sky, as it appears opposite to
the Long Isle. Upon this representation of Sky are marked
these two places, viz., Dunvegan and Gualtergill. Above the
boat the clouds are represented heavy and lowring, and the rain
is falling from them. The motto above the clouds, <em>i.e.</em> round
the edge of the lid by the hinge, is this&mdash;<span class="smcap">Olim hæc meminisse
juvabit&mdash;Aprilis</span> 26<sup><em>to</em></sup> 1746. The inscription under the sea,
<em>i.e.</em> round the edge of the lid by the opening, is this&mdash;<span class="smcap">Quid,
Neptune, paras? Fatis agitamur iniquis.</span> Upon the bottom
of the box are carved the following words&mdash;<span class="smcap">Donald MacLeod
of Gualtergill</span>, in the Isle of Sky, <span class="smcap">the faithfull Palinurus</span>,
Æt.68, 1746. Below these words there is very prettily
engraved a dove, with an olive branch in her bill.</p>

<p>When Donald came first to see me, along with Deacon
Clark, I asked him why he had not snuff in the pretty box?
'Sneeshin in that box!' said Donald. 'Na, the deel a pickle
sneeshin shall ever go into it till the K&mdash;&mdash; be restored, and
then (I trust in God) I'll go to London, and then will I put
[<em>fol.</em> 317.]
sneeshin in the box and go to the Prince, and say, "Sir, will
you tak a sneeshin out o' my box?"'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">20 Aug.</div>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Donald MacLeod, in giving his Journal, chused
rather to express himself in Erse than in Scots (as indeed he
does not much like at any time to speak in Scots), and Malcolm
MacLeod and James MacDonald explained to me. I
was always sure to read over every sentence, in order to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of them all if I was exactly right. Malcolm MacLeod and
James MacDonald were exceedingly useful to me in prompting
Donald, particularly the former, who having heard Donald
tell his story so often before in company, put him in mind of
several incidents that he was like to pass over. Donald desired
Malcolm to refresh his memory where he thought he stood in
need, for that it was not possible for him to mind every thing
exactly in such a long tract of time, considering how many different
shapes and dangers they had gone through in that time.</p>

<p>August 20th. When I was writing Donald's journal from
his own mouth, I did not part with him till betwixt 10 and 11
o'clock at night, and before we parted, our company increased
to 16 or 17 in number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 Sept.</div>

<p>Some days after this Donald MacLeod and James MacDonald
[<em>fol.</em> 318.]
coming to dine with my Lady Bruce, I made an appointment
with Donald to meet James MacDonald and me upon Monday,
September 7th, with a view to dine with Mr. David Anderson,
senior, in the Links of Leith, who was very desirous to see
Donald, and to converse with him for some time. Upon the
day appointed Donald came down from Edinburgh, and
brought along with him Ned Bourk, to shew him Mr. Anderson's
house. When Ned was known to be the person that was
along with Donald, he was desired to come into the house and
get his dinner. I went out from the company a little to converse
with Ned, who put into my hand a paper, telling me
that this was his account of the matter. When I returned to
the company, I told them what I had got from Ned, and they
were all desirous to know the contents of it. After dinner,
when I was reading Ned's Journal, Donald MacLeod frowned,
and was not pleased with his account of things, and therefore
would needs have Ned brought into the room to answer for
himself. Accordingly Ned was called in, and after a pretty
long and warm debate betwixt them in Erse, we found that
Donald's finding fault amounted to no more than that Ned
had omitted to mention several things, which Ned acknowledged
to be the case, confessing that his memory did not serve
him as to many particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9 Sept.</div>

<p>The Journal had been taken from Ned's own mouth in a
[<em>fol.</em> 319.]
very confused, unconnected way, as indeed it requires no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
attention and pains to come at Ned's<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> meaning in what he narrates,
because he speaks the Scots exceedingly ill. I therefore
desired Ned to be with me in my own room upon Wednesday's
afternoon, September 9th, that I might have the opportunity of
going through his Journal with him at leisure, and likewise of
having an account from his own mouth how he happen'd to be
so lucky as to escape being made a prisoner, when so many
were catched upon the Long Isle, where he skulked for some
time. Ned kept his appointment, as will hereafter appear.</p>

<p>Though Donald MacLeod's history be most extraordinary in
all the several instances of it (especially considering his advanced
age), yet when he arrived at Leith, he had not wherewith
to bear his charges to Sky, where he has a wife and
children, from whom he had been absent for at least one year
and an half. There was therefore a contribution set on foot
for him in and about Edinburgh; and I own I had a great
anxiety for my own share to make out for honest <span class="smcap">Palinurus</span> (if
possible) a pound sterling for every week he had served the
Prince in distress; and (I thank God) I was so happy as to
[<em>fol.</em> 320.]
accomplish my design exactly. Donald MacLeod and James
MacDonald came from the Links of Leith to my room, as they
were to sup that night with my Lady Bruce upon invitation.
I then delivered into Donald's own hand, in lieu of wages for
his services of ten weeks,</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="leith">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">£10</td><td align="right">0</td><td align="left">0 Sterling.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The above sum went through my hands in the compass of
about thirteen months and an half. Meantime I have not
reckoned up a guinea, half a guinea, or a crown, which I had
from time to time from my Lady Bruce, as a necessitous
sufferer happened to come in the way.</p>

<p>God Almighty bless and reward all those who liberally contributed
for the support of the indigent and the deserving in
times of the greatest necessity and danger, for Jesus Christ's
sake. Amen and Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">20 Aug.</div>

<p>At the same time above mentioned, I gave Donald MacLeod
the trouble of two letters, copies whereof follow.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

of Kingsburgh in Sky.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">7 Sept.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I could not think of honest Palinurus's setting
out upon his return to Sky, without giving you the trouble of
some few lines, to wish you and Mrs. MacDonald much joy
[<em>fol.</em> 321.]
and happiness in being at your own fireside again. You and
all your concerns are frequently made mention of here with
very much respect; and so long as a spark of honesty remains,
the name of <span class="smcap">MacDonald of Kingsburgh</span> will ever have a mark
of veneration put upon it.</p>

<p>You know very well how I employ much of my time in a
certain affair. I have already made up a collection of between
twenty-four and thirty sheets of paper, and I would fain flatter
myself with the hopes of still increasing the number till the
collection be made compleat, by your assistance and that of
other worthies who prefer truth to falshoods, and honesty to
trick and deceit. Now is the time or never to make a discovery
of facts and men; and it is pity to omit any expedient
that may tend to accomplish the good design.</p>

<p>I gave Captain Malcolm MacLeod the trouble of a written
Memorandum, which I hope you will honour with a plain and
distinct return; and hereby I assure you no other use shall be
made of it but to preserve it for posterity; it being my intention
not so much as to speak of it, and to make a wise and
discreet use of every discovery I am favoured with.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 322.]
I wish the worthy Armadale would be so good as to give
his part of the management from his own mouth. But as I
have writ fully by the same hand to the faithful Captain
Malcolm MacLeod upon this and some other particulars, to
his letter I refer you, and I hope you will join your endeavours
with him in serving the cause of truth and justice.</p>

<p>For my own part I am resolved to leave no stone unturn'd to
expiscate facts and characters, that so <em>the honest man</em> may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
known and revered, and those of the opposite stamp may have
their due.</p>

<p>That God Almighty may ever have you, Mrs. MacDonald,
and all your concerns in His holy care and protection, is the
hearty and earnest prayer of, my dear Sir, your most affectionate
friend and very humble servant,</p>

<p><em>Citadel of Leith, September 7th, 1747.</em>
</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Palinurus</span> has promised to drop me a line by post to
inform me of his safe arrival, and about your welfare, and that
of other friends. Pray keep him in mind of his promise, and
let him not mention any other thing in his letter. Is it possible
to get Boisdale's part from himself? I would gladly have it.
You see I am exceedingly greedy. Adieu.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

of <span class="smcap">Castle</span> in <span class="smcap">Raaza</span>.</h2>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 323.] <span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;This comes by honest <span class="smcap">Palinurus</span> to congratulate
you upon your safe return to your own place; I wish I could
say to your own fireside. But I hope that and all other losses
will be made up to you with interest in due time. A mind
free from the sting of bitter reflections is a continual feast, and
will serve to inspire a man with spirits in a low and suffering
state of life, made easy by contentment, whilst others are
miserable under a load of riches and power, and must betake
themselves to a crowd of company to keep them from thinking.</p>

<p>I hope you are happy in meeting with Mrs. MacLeod in
good health. Long may ye live together, and may your
happiness increase.</p>

<p>I need not put you in mind of my Memorandum to Kingsburgh,
and of your promise to procure me an exact account
from the mouth of your brother-in-law, Mr. MacKinnon, as to
his particular concern in the adventure, for you have too much
honour to neglect anything committed to your trust.</p>

<p>I heartily wish that honest Armadale could be prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
upon to give a full and plain account of his part of the management
[<em>fol.</em> 324.]
in a certain affair which is very much wanted. If he
intends to visit Miss Flora while in Edinburgh, I then can have
the happiness of conversing with that truly valuable man, and
of getting his history from his own mouth. But if he comes
not to this country soon, I earnestly beg you'll employ your
good offices with him to allow you to write it down in his own
words. Though I have not the honour of that worthy gentleman's
acquaintance, please make him an offer of my best wishes
to him and his family in the kindest manner, and tell him that
he has a most amiable character amongst the honest folks in
and about this place. May God Almighty multiply his blessings
upon him, and all his concerns both here and hereafter.</p>

<p>If I rightly remember I desired the favour of you to lay
yourself out in procuring me an exact account of all the cruelties
and barbarities, the pillagings and burnings, you can get any
right intelligence about, which will be an infinite service done
to truth. In doing of this be so good as to be very careful in
finding out the names of persons and places as much as possible.
But where the names cannot be discovered, still let the facts
themselves be particularly set down.</p>

<p>Though I have not the honour of being known to the worthy
[<em>fol.</em> 325.]
family of Raaza, I beg my most respectful compliments may be
presented to them.</p>

<p>I need not mention to you that regard which is entertained
for you by the worthy person, the protection of whose roof I
enjoy; for I dare say you cannot fail to be sensible with what
respect you and all such are made mention of here.</p>

<p>That God Almighty may bless you and Mrs. MacLeod with
health and happiness and give you your hearts desire is the
hearty and earnest prayer of, my dear Sir, Your most
affectionate friend and very humble servant,</p>

<p><em>Citadel of Leith, September 7th, 1747.</em>
</p>

though true as steel, was the rough man, and that he
used great freedoms; for he had seen him frequently

<p class="hanging">At the hour appointed (4 o'clock) Ned Bourk came to my
room, when I went through his Journal with him at
great leisure, and from his own mouth made those
passages plain and intelligible that were written in confused,
indistinct terms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">A Short but Genuine Account of Prince Charlie's
Wanderings from Culloden to his meeting with
Miss MacDonald, by Edward Bourk.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">1746
16 Apr.</div>

<p>Upon the 16th of April 1746 we marched from the field of
Culloden to attack the enemy in their camp at Nairn, but
orders were given by a false<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> general to retreat to the place
from whence we had come, and to take billets in the several
parts where we had quartered formerly. The men being all
much fatigued, some of them were dispersed here and there in
order to get some refreshment for themselves, whilst the greater
part of them went to rest. But soon after, the enemy appearing
behind us, about four thousand of our men were with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
got together and advanced, and the rest were awakened by the
[<em>fol.</em> 327.]
noise of the canon, which surely put them in confusion. After
engaging briskly there came up between six and seven hundred
Frazers commanded by Colonel Charles Frazer, younger, of
Inverallachie, who were attacked before they could form in line
of battle, and had the misfortune of having their Colonel
wounded, who next day was murdered in cold blood, the fate
of many others.</p>

<p>Our small, hungry, and fatigued army being put into confusion
and overpowered by numbers, was forced to retreat.
Then it was that Edward Bourk fell in with the Prince, having
no right guide and very few along with him. The enemy kept
such a close fire that the Prince had his horse shot under him;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
who, calling for another, was immediately served with one by
a groom or footman, who that moment was killed by a canon
bullet. In the hurry, the Prince's bonnet happening to fall
off, he was served with a hat by one of the life-guards.
Edward Bourk, being well acquainted with all them bounds,
undertook to be the Prince's guide and brought him off with
Lord Elcho, Sir Thomas Sheridan, Mr. Alexander MacLeod,
aid-de-camp, and Peter MacDermit, one of the Prince's footmen.
Afterwards they met with O'Sullivan, when they were
but in very bad circumstances. The Prince was pleased to say
to Ned, if you be a true friend, pray endeavour to lead us safe
off. Which honour Ned was not a little fond of, and promised
[<em>fol.</em> 328.]
to do his best. Then the Prince rode off from the way of the
enemy to the Water of Nairn, where, after advising, he dismist
all the men that were with him, being about sixty of Fitz-James's
horse that had followed him. After which Edward
Bourk said, 'Sir, if you please, follow me. I'll do my endeavour
to make you safe.' The Prince accordingly followed him, and
with Lord Elcho, Sir Thomas Sheridan, O'Sullivan, and Mr.
Alexander MacLeod, aid-de-camp, marched to Tordarroch,
where they got no access, and from Tordarroch through Aberarder,
where likewise they got no access; from Aberarder to
Faroline, and from Faroline to Gortuleg, where they met with
Lord Lovat, and drank three glasses of wine with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">April</div>

<p>About 2 o'clock next morning with great hardships we
arrived at the Castle of Glengary, called Invergary, where the
guide (Ned Burk) spying a fishing-net set, pulled it to him and
found two salmonds, which the guide made ready in the best
manner he could, and the meat was reckoned very savoury and
acceptable. After taking some refreshment the Prince wanted
to be quit of the cloathing he had on, and Ned gave him his
own coat. At 3 o'clock afternoon, the Prince, O'Sullivan,
another private gentleman, and the guide set out and came to
the house of one Cameron of Glenpean, and stayed there all
night. In this road we had got ourselves all nastied, and when
[<em>fol.</em> 329.]
we were come to our quarters, the guide happening to be
untying the Prince's spatter dashes, there fell out seven guineas.
They being alone together, the Prince said to the guide,
'Thou art a trusty friend and shall continue to be my servant.'</p>

<p>From Glenpean we marched to Mewboll, where we stayed
one night, and were well entertained. Next morning we went
to Glenbiasdale, stayed there four nights or thereabouts, and
from that we took boat for the Island of South Uist, about six
nights before the 1st of May, where we arrived safely but with
great difficulty. There we stayed three days or so, and then
we boated for the Island Scalpa, or Glass, and arrived at
Donald Campbell's house.</p>

<p>When I asked at Ned to whom Scalpay belonged, he answered,
To the Laird of MacLeod. I asked likewise, what this Donald
Campbell was? Ned told me that he was only a tenant, but
one of the best, honestest fellows that ever drew breath; and
that his forefathers (from father to son) had been in Scalpa
for several generations past. Ned said he believed they were
of the Campbells of Lochniel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May</div>

<p>In Scalpa we stayed about three days, sending from thence
our barge to Stornway to hire a vessel. By a letter from
Donald MacLeod we came to Loch Seaforth, and coming there
by a false guide, we travelled seven hours, if not more, under
cloud of night, having gone six or eight miles out of our way.
This guide was sent to Stornway to know if the vessel was
[<em>fol.</em> 330.]
hired. Either by him or some other enemy it was divulged that
the Prince was at Kildun's house (MacKenzie) in Arynish,
upon which a drum beat in Stornway, and upwards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
an hundred men conveened to apprehend us. However the
MacKenzies proved very favourable and easy, for they could
have taken us if they had pleased. We were then only
four in number besides the Prince, and we had four hired men
for rowing the barge. Upon the alarm Ned Burk advised they
should take to the mountains; but the Prince said, 'How long
is it, Ned, since you turned cowardly? I shall be sure of the
best of them ere taken, which I hope shall never be in life.'
That night he stood opposite to the men that were gathered
together, when two of our boatmen ran away and left us. The
rogue that made the discovery was one MacAulay, skipper of
the vessel that was hired, who next morning went off to Duke
William with information. In the morning we had killed a
quey of little value, and about 12 o'clock at night our little
barge appeared to us, whereof we were very glad. We put
some pieces of the quey in the barge and then went on board.
We rowed stoutly; but spying four men of war at the point of
the Isle of Keaback we steered to a little desart island where
were some fishermen who had little huts of houses like swine's
[<em>fol.</em> 331.]
huts where it seems they stayed and made ready their meat
while at the fishing. They were frighted at seeing our barge
sailing towards the island, and apprehending we had been
a press boat from the men-of-war they fled and left all their
fish.</p>

<p>When landed Edward Burk began to dress some of the fish,
but said he had no butter. The Prince said, 'We will take
the fish till the butter come.' Ned, minding there was some
butter in the barges laid up among bread, went to the barge
and brought it; but it did not look so very clean, the bread
being all broke in pieces amongst the butter; and therefore
Ned said he thought shame to present it. The Prince
asked if the butter was clean when put amongst the bread.
Ned answered it was. 'Then,' said the Prince, 'it will
do very well. The bread is no poison; it can never file
the butter.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>Ned having forgot here to mention the cake which the
Prince contrived with the cow's brains I asked him about it;
and he acknowledged the truth of it. I likewise asked him
if he knew the name of the desart island; but he frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
owned that he did not know it, assuring me in the mean time
that Donald MacLeod knew it well.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Upon the desart island we stayed four nights, and on the
[<em>fol.</em> 332.]
5th set to sea and arrived at the Island Glass, where we were
to enquire about the hire of Donald Campbell's boat. Here
four men appeared coming towards them, upon which Ned
Burk went out of the boat to view them, and giving a whistle,
cried back to his neighbours, being at some distance, to take
good care of the boat. Ned not liking these men at all,
thought fit to return with speed to the boat, and putting his
hand to the gunnel jumped aboard and stayed not to converse
with the four men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.</div>

<p>From Glass, having no wind, we rowed off with vigour.
About break of day, the wind rising, we hoisted sail; and all
of us being faint for lake of food, and having some meal, we
began to make drammach (in Erse, stappack) with salt water,
whereof the Prince took a share, calling it no bad food, and
all the rest followed his example. The Prince called for a
bottle of spirits, and gave every one of us a dram. Then we
passed by Finsbay, in the Isle of Harris, where we spied a
man-of-war, commanded by one Captain Ferguson, under full
sail, and our little sail was full too. He pursued us for three
leagues; but we escaped by plying our oars heartily, they
being better to us than arms could have been at that time.
The water failing the man-of-war, he was not in a condition
[<em>fol.</em> 333.]
to pursue farther. We steered upon a point called Rondill,
when the Prince expressed himself as formerly that he should
never be taken in life. After this the said Captain Ferguson,
being anxious to know what we were, endeavoured to make up
with us a second time, but to no purpose, the water being at
ebb, and we continuing still to row in amongst the creeks.
Seeing this he turned to the main sea, when we sailed to Lochmaddy
to the south of the Isle of Uist, thence to Loch-uiskibay,
thence to an island in said loch, where we came to
a poor grasskeeper's bothy or hut, which had so laigh a door
that we digged below the door and put heather below the
Prince's knees, he being tall, to let him go the easier into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
poor hut. We stayed there about three nights, and provided
ourselves very well in victuals by fowling and fishing, and
drest them in the best shapes we could, and thought them very
savoury meat. Thence we went to the mountain of Coradale,
in South Uist, and stayed there about three weeks, where the
Prince one day, seeing a deer, run straight towards him, and
firing offhand killed him. Edward Burk brought home the
deer, and making ready some collops, there comes a poor boy,
[<em>fol.</em> 334.]
who, without asking questions, put his hand among the meat,
which the cook (Edward Burk) seeing, gave him a whip with
the back of his hand. The Prince observing this, said, 'O
man, you don't remember the Scripture which commands to
feed the hungry and cleed the naked, etc. You ought rather
to give him meat than a strip.' The Prince then ordered some
rags of cloaths for the boy, and said he would pay for them,
which was done accordingly. The Prince added more, saying,
'I cannot see a Christian perish for want of food and raiment
had I the power to support them.' Then he prayed that God
might support the poor and needy, etc.</p>

<p>There was one Donald MacLeod of Gualtergill, a trusty
friend, who went to Moidart and brought us news and brandy,
for which the Prince thanked him heartily, calling him a
trusty servant.</p>

<p>The foresaid boy after [being] fed and cloathed, hearing of
the enemy's approaching in search of the Prince, (like Judas)
thought fit to go privately to them, being fifteen hundred of
Campbells, MacLeods, and MacDonalds, to inform them where
the Prince was, which some of the enemy hearing, ridiculed
the boy, and said he deserved to be thrown into the sea, for
what he advanced was entirely false and all lies.</p>

<p>Now, the enemy coming from the Isle of Barra, who were
well known in these places, and we being utter strangers, with
[<em>fol.</em> 335.]
the disadvantage too of some men-of-war lying before, we had
no way to escape. But committing ourselves to Providence,
the Prince, O'Sullivan, O'Neil (who had come on an errand
from France), Donald MacLeod, Edward Burk, and the boatmen
went on board the barge, to be sure melancholy enough,
having none to trust in but the Providence of God only, we
escaped narrowly by Ouia Island to Benbicula, in Clanronald's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
country. We stayed there for about two nights; but the
enemy came to that country likewise in search of the Prince,
where one Hamar MacLeod landed near our quarters; which
the Prince being informed of, asked at Edward Burk, 'Is this
a friend or a foe?' To which Ned answered, 'He never was a
friend to your family.' But by good providence Hamar
happened to go off without making any search, and we did
not think proper to go the same way with him, not knowing
what the event may have been.</p>

<p>Immediately after this the Prince with O'Neil only went to
the wilderness, desiring we might stay behind with this design
that if any enquiry was made about him, our answer should be
that we knew nothing about him at all further than that by
that time we believed he had made his escape. We all resolved
[<em>fol.</em> 336.]
to suffer than that the Prince should be exposed. Meantime
Providence ordered it otherwise, for without trouble we
escaped also, and afterwards met with the Prince, and that
night boated in our little barge and sailed by Ouia, above the
island of Benbicula, where from the point of a rock a young
seal (a whelp) swimmed directly to the barge as if it had been
frighted; and Edward Burk leaning over the side of the boat,
pulled the seal into the boat; but it died soon after. The
same night we rowed and sailed with vigour, when we spied
two men-of-war with one Captain Scott, not knowing the
names of any of the rest.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> We then steered with all speed to
a shore at Aikersideallach, in South Uist, where coming to a
creek of a rock above the water, and finding some ashes and
the place very private, we kindled up a fire; and the Prince
lay that night in a clift of the rock, drawing his bonnet over
his eyes for preserving them. Ned Burk, as he was turning
himself, the place being exceedingly narrow, and he not adverting
to that, fell backwards over the rock about six yards high,
and narrowly escaped being bruised, by falling among sand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>Afterwards we took boat and rowed to the south part of South
Uist for Loch Boisdale, when we perceived fifteen sail, and a
number of the enemy being upon the land, we knew not [<em>fol.</em> 337.]
what to do. All that day we were obliged to keep in a narrow<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
creek till night that we got into Loch Boisdale. Afterwards coming
ashore very much fatigued, we came to an old tower in the mouth of
the island, where we kindled fire, put on our pot in order to make
ready some provisions; and Ned Burk went out to pull some heath for
the Prince's bed. Meantime Donald MacLeod of Gualtergill said there
were two French ships of war appearing; but to our great surprize
they proved to be Englishmen. The Prince with three others took to
the mountains, and the rowers went to the barge lying in the creek
and steered up the loch.</p>

<p>The men-of-war steered to the main. At night we all met
again at our barge, wherein we had still some small provisions.
We stayed in the open fields two nights, having only the sails
of the boat for covers. On the third night we went farther
into the loch, and rested thereabouts for other two nights.
When the enemy (viz., redcoats and Campbells) appeared,
then we passed to the north side of the loch.</p>

<p>The Prince, finding himself so invironed by the enemy, took
[<em>fol.</em> 338.]
two shirts under his arm and went off, allowing none to follow
him but O'Neil. After parting from the rest the Prince on
the other side of the mountain met with one Neil MacDonald,
who conveyed him that night near to one Lauchlan MacDonald,
a falsified friend, who designed to have betrayed both
the Prince and his country. But Neil MacDonald, finding out
his design, conveyed the Prince to Benbicula, a place then
called Rushness, where he met with one Florence MacDonald,
stepdaughter to MacDonald of Armadale, who pretended to
cross the sea to visit her mother in Sky, when the Prince went
along with her, having disguised himself in women's cloaths,
and changing his name to Bettie Burk, the sirname of his first
guide.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen and ladies, who read this, believe it to be a
true and genuine short account of hardships that happened
and what the author saw. But for brevity's sake I have not
made mention of many wants the Prince suffered, the many
ill-drest diets he got, the many bad beds he lay in, the many
cold and wet beds in the open fields, etc., with all which he
chearfully and patiently put up; and this any well-thinking
person may easily consider from what is above set down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<h2>September 9th, 1747. After going thro' the Journal
with Ned I writ from his own mouth the following
Account, etc.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">9 Sept.
1747</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 339.] Edward Burk, after parting with the Prince, went over
North Strand to North Uist, where he skulked in a hill called
Eval for about seven weeks, twenty days of which he had not
any other meat than dilse and lammocks, a kind of shell fish,
for much about this time a paper had been read in all the
kirks strictly forbidding all persons to give so much as a
mouthful of meat to a rebel, otherwise they should be destroyed.
Upon this Oliver Burk, a married man, and brother
to Ned, would not give poor Ned a bit of bread, or any
countenance whatsomever, being frighted out of his wits. But
Ned resolved to take amends of him for his cruel cowardice,
and went to a place where Oliver had a flock of sheep feeding.
Ned took the head off one of them, and throwing the body
over his shoulder, carried it to a place where he could order it
at his conveniency. But Jacob Burk, an unmarried man, and
brother to Ned, did as much as could lie in his power, and
[<em>fol.</em> 340.]
gave Ned everything he could purchase, and did not fear at all.
God bless poor Jacob. One night, Ned being in great misery,
went to steal a boat in order to take the sea. But some fishers
being near by, and hearing a noise, came out with a force,
thinking this to be an enemy. Ned was obliged to leave the
boat and take to his heels, for he had far rather have been
killed or drowned than to be taken prisoner, because by that
time it was well known that he had been the Prince's servant,
and therefore he was afraid, if taken, they would put him to
the torture to make him tell all that he knew, and he could
not bear the thoughts of doing hurt to anybody.</p>

<p>A near relation of his own (Peter MacDonald) put him to
much trouble, having gone to Captain John MacDonald, son
of Tutor MacDonald in North Uist, in order to put Ned out,
and get a party to catch him. But Captain John broke a staff
over the fellow's head and told him he had other uses for his
men than to send them upon false errands. At that time Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
went to Lochmaddy in North Uist, where one of the Independent
Company (commanded by the said John MacDonald)
came to him and desired him to follow him. Ned asked to
what place was he to follow him? 'Farther into the country,'
said the fellow. 'Friend,' said Ned, 'have you got any more
[<em>fol.</em> 341.]
help than yourself?' 'No,' replied the fellow. 'And, Sir,
you are one of the Prince's servants?' Ned answered, 'Many a
prettier fellow had been his servant.' The fellow added that
he knew Ned's face. Upon which Ned owned his name, and
said he would not deny it, and immediately drew his pistol,
which frighted the fellow so that he ran off with himself.
But soon after he brought a party to the same spot to seize
Ned, but he had got himself hid in a private place.</p>

<p>This made Ned more careful and timorous, especially as
Donald MacDonald (a son of Clanranald, and one of Ned's
good friends) was under a necessity to deliver himself up,
which put him in no danger, as he was a French officer. After
this Ned was obliged to betake himself to a cave in North
Uist, being so hard beset. A shoemaker's wife, when neither
one friend nor another durst be seen with him, came under
cloud of night and brought him a little food.</p>

<p>A little before this Ned had gone one day to buy a pair of
shoes at Clatachcaranish, when General Campbell, Captain
Ferguson and their whole force came to the place. Ned was
[<em>fol.</em> 342.]
then in a sad perplexity, and did not well know what to do.
Spying an old black coat and a pair of old breeches in the
house, he put them on, hiding his own cloaths under a chest,
and went out at the door unconcerned. He stood a while
among the men and conversed easily with them, then slipping
by degrees out amongst them, he got to the hills to his old
cave. Jacob Burk and the shoemaker's wife got his cloaths
(a highland dress) and brought them to him.</p>

<p>At last Ned resolved, right or wrong, to get out of these
hardships, and, making his way to Lochmaddy, found there a
vessel ready to ferry some cattle over to Sky. Ned gave a
false token to the skipper in place of a pass, and got on board.
When he arrived in Sky he came to a gentleman's house of the
name of MacLeod, near which place MacDonald of Knock
coming with a command of 36 men, Ned made off, not chusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to have his quarters near any place where Knock was. That
night Ned went to an old kiln-cogie and took his rest, and the
gentleman, MacLeod (in whose house he had been) sent him
meat privately. Next morning, before daylight, he made off
and went to Talisker MacLeod, whom he had served several
years before that, and gave himself up to him. Talisker made
[<em>fol.</em> 343.]
him welcome, and took care of him. Ned, being desirous to be
upon the mainland, took the opportunity of a boat sailing for
Seaforth's country where he met with his master, Mr. Alexander
MacLeod, aid-de-camp, and stayed with him till the
indemnity came out, when he left his master and returned to
Edinburgh, where he follows his old business.</p>

<p>Ned told me that Donald MacLeod, all the time he was
with the Prince, sat at the helm and steered the course, and that
they had neither compass, lamp, nor pump in the great storm
from the mainland to Benbicula, not knowing, through the
darkness and tempest, where they were, or what land they
might make; and therefore they behoved to let the boat drive
and trust all to Providence, for they could do nothing for
themselves. By peep of day, he said, they observed Benbicula
and made to it with great difficulty, the storm continuing no
less than twelve hours after they landed. Ned assured me
that O'Neil's saying that the boat staved to pieces was a
downright falshood; and moreover, he did not doubt but
the eight-oar'd boat was still entire upon the island Scalpa
or Glass.</p>

<p>When I spoke to Ned about the priest's leaving them at
Scalpa, Ned said, 'Faith, I have reason to think that the Prince
[<em>fol.</em> 344.]
is not a great Papist, for he never gree'd well wi' the priest at
all, and was very easy about his company.'</p>

<p>Ned owned the truth of what Donald MacLeod had said
about his using such freedoms with the Prince, and added that
he used to play antiques and monkey tricks to divert the
Prince and his small retinue.</p>

<p>One of the soles of Ned's shoes happening to come off, Ned
cursed the day upon which he should be forced to go without
shoes. The Prince hearing him, called to him and said, 'Ned,
look at me;' 'when,' said Ned, 'I saw him holding up one
of his feet to me where there was deel a sole upon the shoe;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and then I said, 'O my dear, I have nothing more to say.
You have stopt my mouth indeed.'</p>

<p>When Ned was talking of seeing the Prince again he spoke
these words: 'If the Prince do not come and see me soon,
good faith, I will go and see my daughter (Bettie Burk) and
crave her. For she has not yet paid her christening money,
and as little has she paid the coat I gae her in her greatest
need.'</p>

<p class="hanging">N.B.&mdash;Donald MacLeod is much more to be depended upon
than Ned Burk in the account of things, because Ned
[<em>fol.</em> 345.]
can neither write nor read, and was near thirty years
of age before he could speak one word of English.
Ned had a great difficulty to put things together in any
tolerable way, as he is one of these honest, low men
that are intent for the present upon doing their duty
with fidelity without minding anything else. Such
honest, plain persons as these allow the world to rub
on as it pleases, and never once trouble their heads
about making observations and remarks upon the
occurrences of life as they pass along. If they jog on
from day to day they ask no more, and are very much
strangers to the exercises of the memory. Besides,
honest, plain, rough Ned had never entertained a notion
that any journal or account would ever be asked of him,
or else perhaps he would have stored his memory with
a more plentiful stock, as he had abundance of materials
to work upon. Honest Ned is not (by his own confession)
much above forty years of age, and is both stout

<span class="smcap">Journal</span> of the Prince's imbarkation and arrival,
etc., the greatest part of which was taken from
<span class="smcap">Duncan Cameron</span> at several different conversations

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 346.] After the battle of Fontenoy and taking of Tournay, among
other regiments the one commanded by Lord John Drummond
was garrisoned in Tournay, in which corps Duncan
Cameron (some time servant to old Lochiel at Boulogne in
France) served. When Duncan was in Tournay he received a
letter from Mr. Æneas MacDonald, banker in Paris, desiring
him forthwith to repair to Amiens, and if possible to post it
without sleeping, where he should receive orders about what
he was to do. Accordingly Duncan set out, and in a very
short time posted to Amiens, from whence Æneas, etc., had set
out, but had left a letter for Duncan ordering him to follow
them to Nantes, to which place he set out without taking any
rest, where he found the Prince and his small retinue, consisting
of seven only, besides servants.</p>

<p>The seven were the Duke of Athol, Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald, Colonel Strickland, Captain O'Sullivan,
Mr. George Kelly (a nonjurant clergyman), and Æneas
MacDonald, banker at Paris, brother to Kinlochmoidart.</p>

<p>As Duncan Cameron had been brought up in the island
[<em>fol.</em> 347.]
of Barra, and knew the coast of the Long Isle well, in some
part of which the Prince intended to land first, so Duncan's
business was to descry to them the Long Isle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>At Nantes the Prince and his few attendants waited about
fifteen days before the <em>Elizabeth</em> ship of war came, which was
to be their convoy in the expedition. To cover the design the
better, Sir Thomas Sheridan<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> passed for the father, and the
Prince for the son, for none knew the Prince to be in company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
but the seven, some few others, and Mr. Welch (an Irishman, a
very rich merchant in Nantes), who was to command the frigate
of sixteen guns,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> on board of which the Prince and the few
faithful friends with the servants were to imbark.</p>

<p>After the Prince was on board he dispatched letters to his
father, and the King of France, and the King of Spain, advising
them of his design, and no doubt desiring assistance.</p>

<p>The Prince when in Scotland, used to say that the 10th of
June was the day on which he stole off, and that he did not
mind it to be his father's birth-day till night was far spent.
From whence some have affirmed that to have been the day of
the embarkation, and others to have been the day when he left
Paris and began to be incog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9 July.</div>

<p>They had not been above five or six days at sea, till one
[<em>fol.</em> 348.]
evening the <em>Lyon</em> ship of war appeared, and came pretty near
them, and then disappeared. Next morning she came again
in view and disappeared. She continued to do so three or
four times, and the last time of her appearing she came within
a mile or so of them; when the captain of the <em>Elizabeth</em> (a
Frenchman) came on board the frigate, and told Mr. Welch if
he would assist him by keeping one side of the <em>Lyon</em> in play
at a distance, he would immediately put all things in order for
the attack. Mr. Welch, well knowing the trust he had on
board, answered him civilly, and told him it was what he could
not think of doing, and withal remarked to him it was his
humble opinion that he should not think of fighting unless he
should happen to be attacked, because his business was to be
convoy to the frigate in the voyage. However, he said, as
he pretended not to any command over him, he might do as
he thought proper.</p>

<p>The French captain to all this replied, that from the <em>Lion's</em>
appearing and disappearing so often, it seemed as if she were
looking out for another ship to assist her, and if she should
happen to be joined by any other, they no doubt would
instantly fall upon the <em>Elizabeth</em> and the frigate, and devour
them both; and therefore he behoved to think it the wisest
course to fight the <em>Lion</em> when single, because the <em>Elizabeth</em> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that case was fit enough for the engagement, and would bid
[<em>fol.</em> 349.]
fair enough to give a good account of the <em>Lion</em>. Upon this
the French captain drew his sword, took leave of Mr. Welch
and his company, went on board the <em>Elizabeth</em> with his sword
still drawn in his hand, and gave the necessary orders for the
attack.</p>

<p>Immediately the <em>Elizabeth</em> bore down upon the <em>Lion</em> (each
of them consisting of about sixty guns, and therefore equally
matched), and began the attack with great briskness. The
fight continued for five or six hours, when the <em>Lion</em> was obliged
to sheer off like a tub upon the water.</p>

<p>About the time when the captain came on board the frigate,
the Prince was making ready to go on board the <em>Elizabeth</em> for
more air and greater conveniency every way, the frigate being
crowded with the gentlemen, the servants, and the crew. His
friends reckoned it very lucky that he had not gone on board.</p>

<p>The frigate all the time of the engagement lay at such a small
distance, that (as the Prince observed to several friends in Scotland)
the <em>Lion</em> might have sunk her with the greatest ease.
But he said it was their good fortune that the <em>Lion</em> had despised
[<em>fol.</em> 350.]
them, and thought not the frigate worth the while. Besides,
the <em>Lion</em> found enough of employment for all her hands in
playing her part against the <em>Elizabeth</em>.</p>

<p>During the time of the fight the Prince several times observed
to Mr. Welch what a small assistance would serve to give the
<em>Elizabeth</em> the possession of the <em>Lion</em>, and importuned him to
engage in the quarrel. But Mr. Welch positively refused, and
at last behoved to desire the Prince not to insist any more,
otherwise he would order him down to the cabin.</p>

<p>After the fight was all over, Mr. Welch sailed round the
<em>Elizabeth</em>, and enquired particularly how matters stood with
the captain and the crew. A lieutenant came upon deck from
the captain, who was wounded in his cabin, and told Mr.
Welch that between thirty and forty officers and gentlemen
(besides common men) were killed and wounded, and that if
Mr. Welch could supply him with a mainmast and some rigging,
he would still make out the voyage with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Welch replied that he could not furnish him with either
mainmast or rigging, and that although he should have happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 351.]
to be capable to serve him in these things, yet he would
not have made it his choice to lose so much time as it would
require to put the <em>Elizabeth</em> in some better order. He desired
to tell the captain it was his opinion that he should without
loss of time return to France, and that he himself would do
his best to make out the intended voyage. The <em>Elizabeth</em>
accordingly returned to France, and the frigate continued her
course to the coast of Scotland. She had not been long parted
from the <em>Elizabeth</em> till the crew descried two ships of war at
some distance, which they could not have well got off from; but
that a mist luckily interveened, and brought them out of sight.</p>

<p>Two or three hours before landing, an eagle came hovering
over the frigate, and continued so to do till they were all safe
on shore. Before dinner the Duke of Athol had spied the
eagle; but (as he told several friends in Scotland) he did not
chuse then to take any notice of it, lest they should have called
it a Highland freit in him. When he came upon deck after
dinner, he saw the eagle still hovering about in the same
manner, and following the frigate in her course, and then he
could not help remarking it to the Prince and his small retinue,
[<em>fol.</em> 352.]
which they looked upon with pleasure. His grace, turning to
the Prince said, 'Sir, I hope this is an excellent omen, and
promises good things to us. The king of birds is come to
welcome your royal highness upon your arrival in Scotland.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">21 July.</div>

<p>When they were near the shore of the Long Isle, Duncan
Cameron was set out in the long boat to fetch them a proper
pilot. When he landed he accidentally met with Barra's
piper, who was his old acquaintance, and brought him on
board. The piper piloted them safely into Erisca (about July
21st), a small island lying between Barra and South Uist. 'At
this time,' said Duncan Cameron, 'there was <em>a devil of a
minister</em> that happened to be in the island of Barra, who did
us a' the mischief that lay in his power. For when he had got
any inkling about us, he dispatched away expresses with informations
against us. But as the good luck was, he was not
well believed, or else we would have been a' tane by the neck.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">23 July.</div>

<p>When Duncan spoke these words, '<em>a devil of a minister</em>,' he
bowed low, and said to me, 'Sir, I ask you ten thousand
pardons for saying so in your presence. But, good faith, I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
assure you, sir (asking your pardon), he was nothing else but
the <em>devil of a minister</em>.'</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 353.]
When they landed in Eriska, they could not find a grain of
meal or one inch of bread. But they catched some flounders,
which they roasted upon the bare coals in a mean low hut they
had gone into near the shore, and Duncan Cameron stood cook.
The Prince sat at the cheek of the little ingle, upon a fail sunk,
and laughed heartily at Duncan's cookery, for he himself owned
he played his part awkwardly enough.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">22 July.</div>

<p>Next day the Prince sent for young Clanranald's uncle
(Alexander MacDonald of Boisdale), who lived in South Uist,
and discovered himself to him. This gentleman spoke in a
very discouraging manner to the Prince, and advised him to
return home. To which it is said the Prince replied, 'I am
come home, sir, and I will entertain no notion at all of returning
to that place from whence I came; for that I am persuaded
my faithful Highlanders will stand by me.' Mr. MacDonald
told him he was afraid he would find the contrary. The Prince
condescended upon Sir Alexander MacDonald and the Laird
of MacLeod as persons he might confide in. Mr. MacDonald
begged leave to tell him that he had pitched upon the wrong
[<em>fol.</em> 354.]
persons; for from his own certain knowledge he could assure
him these gentlemen would not adhere to his interest; on the
contrary, they might chance to act an opposite part. And
seeing the Prince had been pleased to mention Sir Alexander
MacDonald's name, Boisdale desired he might run off an
express to him, and let his return be the test of what he had
advanced. He added withal, that if Sir Alexander MacDonald
and the Laird of MacLeod declared for him, it was his opinion
he might then land on the continent, for that he doubted not
but he would succeed in the attempt. But if they should
happen to refuse their assistance (which he still insisted would
be the case), then their example would prove of bad consequence,
and would tend only to make others backward and to
keep at home. And in that event he still thought it advisable
to suggest his returning back to where he came from.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25 July.</div>

<p>According to this advice the Prince did send a message to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Sir Alexander MacDonald, intimating his arrival, and demanding
assistance. Before the messenger could return, Æneas
MacDonald (anxious to have the honour of seeing the Prince
in the house of his brother, the Laird of Kinlochmoidart)
prevailed upon the Prince to set out for the continent, and
[<em>fol.</em> 355.]
they arrived at Boradale in Moidart, or rather Arisaig, upon
July 25th, St. James's day, 1745.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> When the messenger
returned to the Prince he brought no answer with him, for
Sir Alexander refused to give any.</p>

<p>It is worth remarking here that though MacDonald of Boisdale
had played the game of the government by doing all he
could to dissuade the Prince from making the attempt; and
after the standard was set up, by keeping back all Clanranald's
men (to the number of four or five hundred good stout fellows)
that lived in South Uist and the other isles, yet his conduct
could not screen him from rough and severe treatment. For
after the battle of Culloden he suffered in his effects as well as
others, and had the misfortune to be made a prisoner and to
be carried to London by sea, in which expedition he had the
additional affliction of having his brother, the Laird of Clanranald,
senior (who had never stirred from his own fireside), and
his lady to bear him company, and none of them were released
till the 4th of July 1747. However, to do Boisdale justice, he
was of very great use to the Prince (as Donald MacLeod and
Malcolm have both declared) when wandering up and down
[<em>fol.</em> 356.]
through South Uist, Benbicula, and other parts of the Long
Isle, and exerted his utmost power to keep him out of the hands
of his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>After the Prince's arrival upon the continent, some friends
met to consult what was to be done, and I have heard it
affirmed by good authority that Keppoch honestly and bravely
gave it as his opinion that since the Prince had risqued his
person and generously thrown himself into the hands of his
friends, therefore it was their duty to raise their men instantly
merely for the protection of his person, let the consequence be
what it would. Certain it is that if Keppoch, Lochiel, young
Clanranald, etc., had not joined him, he would either have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fallen into the hands of his enemies or been forced immediately
to cross the seas again.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">19 Aug.</div>

<p>The royal standard was set up at Glenfinnan (August 19th),
the property of Clanranald, at the head of Lochshiel, which
marches with Lochiel's ground, and lies about ten miles west
from Fort William. The Prince had been a full week before this,
viz., from Sunday the 11th, at Kinlochmoydart's house, and
Lochiel had been raising his men who came up with them just
as the standard was setting up.</p>

<p>The Prince stayed where the standard was set up two days,
[<em>fol.</em> 357.]
and I have heard Major MacDonell frequently say in the Castle
of Edinburgh, that he had never seen the Prince more chearful
at any time, and in higher spirits than when he had got
together four or five hundred men about the standard. Major
MacDonell presented the Prince with the first good horse he
mounted in Scotland, which the Major had taken from Captain
Scott, son of Scotstarvet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23 Aug.</div>

<p>On Friday, August 23d, the Prince lodged in Fassafern,
three miles down the Loch Eil, and about five miles from Fort
William. On sight of a warship which lay opposite to the
garrison, the Prince crossed a hill and went to Moy or Moidh,
a village on the river Lochy belonging to Lochiel. There he
stayed till Monday, August 26th, waiting intelligence about
General Cope; and that day he crossed the river Lochy, and
lodged in a village called Leterfinla, on the side of Loch Lochy.
At 12 o'clock at night, being very stormy and boisterous, he
learned that General Cope was at Garvaimor, whereupon the
men stood to arms all night. But the General had altered his
route, and by forced marches was making the best of his way
for Inverness, which (as was given out) happened by an express
from President Forbes advising the General not to attempt
[<em>fol.</em> 358.]
going up the country to attack the Highlanders at the Pass of
Coricrag (very strong ground) where they had posted themselves,
but to make all the haste he could to Inverness, where
he might expect the Monroes, etc., to join him, whereby he
would be considerably reinforced.</p>

<p>Upon notice that the General was marching towards Inverness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
about six hundred of the Highlanders urged the being
allowed to follow him under cloud of night and promised to
come up with him and to give a good account of him and his
command. But the Prince would not hear of such an attempt,
and desired them to wait for a more favourable opportunity.
It was with much difficulty that they could be prevailed upon to
lay aside the thoughts of any such enterprize. This I had
from the brave Major MacDonell.</p>

<p>When the Prince was coming down the Highlands to meet
General Cope (as was supposed) he walked sixteen miles in
boots, and one of the heels happening to come off, the Highlanders
said they were unco glad to hear it, for they hoped the
want of the heel would make him march at more leisure. So
speedily he marched that he was like to fatigue them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27 Aug.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 359.]
August 27th. The Prince slept at Glengary's house, and next
night lay at Aberchallader, a village belonging to Glengary.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">30 Aug.</div>

<p>August 30th. The Prince and his army were at Dalnacardoch,
a publick house in Wade's road, as appears from a letter
writ by the Duke of Athol to a lady<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> desiring her to repair to
Blair Castle to put it in some order, and to do the honours of
that house when the Prince should happen to come there,
which he did the day following, August 31st. I saw the letter
and took the date of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">31 Aug.</div>

<p>When the Prince was at Blair he went into the garden, and
taking a walk upon the bowling-green, he said he had never
seen a bowling-green before. Upon which the above lady
called for some bowls that he might see them; but he told her
that he had got a present of some bowls sent him as a
curiosity to Rome from England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2 Sept.</div>

<p>September 2d. He left Blair and went to the house of Lude,
where he was very chearful and took his share in several dances,
such as minuets, Highland reels (the first reel the Prince called
for was, 'This is not mine ain house,' etc.), and a Strathspey
minuet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3 Sept.</div>

<p>September 3d. He was at Dunkeld, and next day he dined
[<i>fol.</i> 360.]
at Nairn House, where some of the company happening to
observe what a thoughtful state his father would now be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from the consideration of those dangers and difficulties he had
to encounter with, and that upon this account he was much
to be pitied, because his mind behoved to be much upon the
rack&mdash;the Prince replied that he did not half so much pity his
father as his brother. 'For,' said he, 'the king has been inured
to disappointments and distresses, and has learnt to bear up
easily under the misfortunes of life. But poor Hary! his young
and tender years make him much to be pitied, for few brothers
love as we do.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 Sept.</div>

<p>September 4th. In the evening he made his entrance into
Perth upon the horse that Major MacDonell had presented
him with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11 Sept.</div>

<p>September 11th. Early in the morning he went on foot
attended by few and took a view of the house of Scoon; and
leaving Perth that day, he took a second breakfast at Gask,
dined at Tullibardine, and that night went towards Dumblain
and next day to Down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">14 Sept.</div>

<p>September 14th. In the morning the Prince, after refreshing
himself and his army at the Laird of Leckie's house, marched
by Stirling Castle and through St. Ninians. From Stirling
Castle a six-pounder was discharged four times at him, which
[<em>fol.</em> 361.]
determined Lord Nairn, who was bringing up the second division
of the army, to go farther up the country in order to be out
of the reach of the canon of the Castle. When the Prince was
in St. Ninians with the first division, Mr. Christie, provost of
Stirling, sent out to them from Stirling a quantity of bread,
cheese, and ale in abundance, an order having come before by
little Andrew Symmer desiring such a refreshment. Colonel
Gardiner and his dragoons had galloped off towards Edinburgh
from their camp near Stirling Castle the night before, or rather
the same morning, when it was dark, September 14th, without
beat of drum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16 Sept.</div>

<p>September 16th. The Prince and his army were at Gray's
Mill upon the Water of Leith, when he sent a summons to the
Provost and Town Council of Edinburgh to receive him quietly
and peaceably into the city. Two several deputations were
sent from Edinburgh to the Prince begging a delay till they
should deliberate upon what was fittest to be done. Meantime
eight or nine hundred Highlanders under the command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Keppoch, young Lochiel, and O'Sullivan, marched in between
the Long Dykes without a hush of noise, under the favour of a
dark night, and lurked at the head of the Canongate about the
[<em>fol.</em> 362.]
Nether Bow Port till they should find a favourable opportunity
for their design, which soon happened. The hackney coach
that brought back the second deputation, entred at the West
Port, and after setting down the deputies at their proper place
upon the street, drove down the street towards the Canongate,
and when the Nether Bow Port was made open to let out the
coach, the lurking Highlanders rushed in (it being then peep
of day) and made themselves masters of the city without any
opposition, or the smallest noise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;When the Prince was marching his army towards
England, Duncan Cameron was ordered to attend the Prince's
baggage, and had got a young horse to ride upon that had not
been accustomed to noise, and therefore threw Duncan upon
hearing the pipes and the drums. Duncan was so bruised with
the fall that he behoved to be left behind, and accordingly was
carried to the house in which Lady Orbiston was then living
in the neighbourhood of Dalkeith. Soon an information was
given that the Highlanders had left one behind them at such
a place, and he was said to be Colonel Strickland in his wounds,
[<em>fol.</em> 363.]
upon which a party of dragoons was dispatched to take the
Colonel prisoner. But they found only plain Duncan, whom
they brought into Edinburgh. He was committed to the city
jayl, where he was so lucky as to be overlooked, either through
sickness or want of evidence, when others were sent off to
England to stand trial. At last he was released, nothing
appearing against him, some time before the indemnity came
out, and got a protection for going to his own country in the
Highlands. However Duncan had no mind to make use of
that protection, being resolved to return to France. He
luckily fell in with Mrs. Fothringham, who was going over to
France to her husband, late governor of Dundee. This lady
was allowed a pass and protection for herself, a child, a man-servant,
and a maid-servant, to sail for Holland. She wanted
much to have Duncan Cameron along with her, because, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the French language well, he would prove an excellent guide
for her to France. Duncan on the other hand was fond of
[<em>fol.</em> 364.]
having it in his power to oblige such a lady, and glad to go
into any scheme whereby he could safely make his way to
Holland, and therefore he agreed to pass for Mrs. Fothringham's
servant, and accordingly he was insert in the pass under the
name of Duncan Campbell, an Argyleshire man. They sailed
from Leith Road on board of one <em>Sibbald</em>, upon Friday, June
19th, and arrived in Holland the 23d, 1747.</p>

<p>It was most lucky for Duncan Cameron that it was never
known to any in the government that he was one of those who
came over in the same frigate with the Prince. The most
distant suspicion was never entertained about this, otherwise
his fate would have turned out in quite another shape.</p>

1745</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 365.] <span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Since my last from Perth it hath pleased God to
prosper your Majesty's arms under my command with a success
that has even surprized my wishes. On the 17th we
entred Edinburgh, sword in hand, and got possession of that
town without being obliged to shed one drop of blood, or to
do any violence. And this morning I have gained a most
signal victory with little or no loss. If I had a squadron or
two of horse to pursue the flying enemy there would not one
man of them have escaped; as it is they have hardly saved
any but a few dragoons who, by a most precipitate flight
will, I believe, get into Berwick. If I had obtained this
victory over foreigners my joy would have been compleat.
But as it is over Englishman, it has thrown a damp upon it
that I little imagined. The men I have defeated were your
Majesty's enemies, it is true, but they might have become your
friends and dutiful subjects when they had got their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 366.]
opened to see the true interest of their country which I am
come to save, not to destroy. For this reason I have discharged
all publick rejoicing. I do not care to enter into the
particulars of the action, and chuse rather that your Majesty
would hear it from another than from myself. I send you
this by Stewart, to whom you may give entire credit. He is
a faithful, honest fellow, and thoroughly instructed in everything
that has happened to this day. I shall have a loss in
him; but I hope it will be soon made up by his speedy return
with the most agreeable news I can receive, I mean that of
your majesty's and my dearest brother's health.</p>

<p>I have seen two or three Gazettes filled with addresses and
mandates from the bishops to the clergy. The addresses are
such as I expected, and can impose on none but the weak and
credulous. The mandates are of the same sort, but were artfully
drawn. They order their clergy to make the people
sensible of the great blessings they enjoy under the present
family that governs them, particularly of the strict administration
of justice, of the sacred regard that is paid to the
laws, and the great security of their religion and property.
This sounds all very well, and may impose upon the unthinking.

But one who reads with a little care will easily see the fallacy.
What occasion has a Prince who has learnt the secret of corrupting
the fountain of all laws to disturb the ordinary course
of justice? Would not this be to give the alarm, and amount
to telling them that he was not come to protect as he pretended,
but really to betray them? When they talk of the
security of their religion, they take care not to mention one
word of the dreadful growth of atheism and infidelity which
(I am extremely sorry to hear from very sensible, sober men)
have within these few years got to a flaming height; even so
far that I am assured many of their most fashionable men are
ashamed to own themselves Christians; and many of the lower
sort act as if they were conversing upon this melancholy
subject.</p>

<p>I was let into a thing which I never understood rightly before,
which is that those men who are loudest in the cry of the
growth of Popery, and the danger of the Protestant religion,
are not really Protestants, but a set of profligate men, of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
parts, with some learning, and void of all principles, but pretending
to be republicans.</p>

<p>I asked those who told me this what should make these men
[<em>fol.</em> 368.]
so zealous about preferring the Protestant religion, seeing they
are not Christians? And was answered that it is in order to
recommend themselves to the ministry, which (if they can
write pamphlets for them, or get themselves chosen members
of Parliament), will be sure to provide amply for them. And
the motive to this extraordinary zeal is that they thereby
procure to themselves the connivance at least, if not the
protection of the Government, while they are propagating
their impiety and infidelity.</p>

<p>I hope in God Christianity is not at so low an ebb in this
country as this account I have had represents it to be. Yet
if I compare what I have formerly seen and heard at Rome,
with something I have observed since I have been here, I am
afraid there is too much truth in it.</p>

<p>The bishops are as unfair and partial in representing the
security of their property as that of their religion, for when
they mention it they do not say a word of the vast load of
debt (that increases yearly) under which the nation is groaning,
and which must be paid (if ever they intend to pay it) out of
their property. It is true all this debt has not been contracted
[<em>fol.</em> 369.]
under the prince of this family, but a great part of
it has, and the whole might have been cleared by a frugal
administration during these thirty years of a profound peace
which the nation has enjoyed, had it not been for the
immense sums that have been squandered away in corrupting
Parliaments and supporting foreign interest that can never
be of any service to these kingdoms. I am afraid I have
taken up too much of your majesty's time about these sorry
mandates, but having mentioned them I was willing to give
your majesty my sense of them.</p>

<p>I remember Dr. Wagstaff (with whom I wish I had conversed
more frequently, for he always told me truth) once said to me
that I must not judge of the clergy of the Church of England
by the bishops, who were not preferred for their piety and
learning, but for very different talents: for writing pamphlets,
for being active at elections, and for voting in Parliament as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the ministry directed them. After I have won another battle
they will write for me, and answer their own letters.</p>

<p>There is another set of men amongst whom I am inclined to
[<em>fol.</em> 370.]
believe the lowest are the honestest, as well as among the
clergy, I mean the army. For never was there a finer body of
men to look at than those I fought with this morning, yet
they did not behave so well as I expected. I thought I could
plainly see that the common men did not like the cause they
were engaged in. Had they been fighting against Frenchmen
come to invade their country I am convinced they would have
made a better defence. The poor men's pay and their low
prospects are not sufficient to corrupt their natural principles
of justice and honesty, which is not the case with their officers,
who, incited by their own ambition and false notions of
honour, fought more desperately. I asked one of them, who
is my prisoner (a gallant man) why he would fight against his
lawful prince, and one who was come to rescue his country
from a foreign yoke. He said he was a man of honour, and
would be true to the Prince, whose bread he ate, and whose
commission he bore. I told him it was a noble principle, but
ill applied, and asked him if he was not a Whig? He replied
that he was. 'Well then,' said I, 'how come you to look on
the commission you bear, and the bread you eat to be the
[<em>fol.</em> 371.]
Prince's and not your country's which raised you, and pays
you to serve and defend it against foreigners, who came not
now to defend but to enslave it, for that I have always understood
to be the true principle of a Whig. Have you not
heard how your countrymen have been carried abroad to be
insulted and maltreated by those defenders, and to be
butchered, fighting in a quarrel in which your country has
little or no concern, only to aggrandize Hanover?' To this he
made no answer, but looked sullen and hung down his head.
The truth is there are few good officers among them. They
are brave, because an Englishman cannot be otherwise, but
they have generally little knowledge in their business, are
corrupt in their morals, and have few restraints from religion,
though they would have you believe they are fighting for it.
As to their honour they talk so much of, I shall soon have
occasion to try it, for, having no strong places to put any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
prisoners in, I shall be obliged to release them upon their
parole. If they do not keep it I wish they may not fall into
my hands again, for in that case it will not be in my power to
protect them from the resentment of my Highlanders, who
[<em>fol.</em> 372.]
would be apt to kill them in cold blood, which (as I take no
pleasure in revenge) would be extremely shocking to me. My
haughty foe thinks it beneath him, I suppose, to settle a
cartel. I wish for it as much for the sake of his men as my
own. I hope ere long I shall make him glad to sue for it.</p>

<p>I hear there are six thousand Dutch troops arrived, and ten
battalions of the English sent for. I wish they were all Dutch
that I might not have the pain of shedding English blood.
I hope I shall soon oblige them to bring over the rest, which
in all events will be one piece of service done to my country in
helping it out of a ruinous foreign war.</p>

<p>It is hard my victory should put me under new difficulties
that I did not feel before, and yet this is the case. I am
now charged with the care both of my friends and enemies.
Those, who should bury the dead, are run away as if it was no
business of theirs. My Highlanders think it beneath them to
do it, and the country people are fled away. However, I am
resolved to try if I can get people for money to undertake it,
[<em>fol.</em> 373.]
for I cannot bear the thoughts of suffering Englishmen to rot
above ground.</p>

<p>I am in great difficulty how I shall dispose of my wounded
prisoners. If I make an hospital of the church it will be
looked upon as a great profanation, as having violated my
manifesto in which I promised to violate no man's property.
If the magistrates would act they would help me out of this
difficulty. Come what will I am resolved I will not suffer the
poor wounded men to lie in the streets, and if I can do no
better I will make an hospital of the palace, and leave it to
them.</p>

<p>I am so distracted with these cares, joined to those of my
own people, that I have only time to add that I am, Sir,
your Majesty's most dutiful son, and obedient servant,</p>

<h2>Edinburgh, Tuesday, August 25th, in the forenoon,
1747. I visited Mrs. <span class="smcap">Cameron</span>, Dr. <span class="smcap">Archibald
Cameron's</span> lady,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> who told me</h2>
<div class="sidenote">25 Aug. 1747</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 374.] That it was a common practice amongst the red-coats after
Culloden battle, dispersed up and down the Highlands, to
raise the bodies of man, woman, and child out of the graves
for greed of the linen, or whatever was wrapped about them,
and after they had taken that off them to leave the bodies
above ground. She herself had two children that died at that
time, and she was advised to bury them privately in some
remote heathy brae, to prevent their being taken up again;
but she could not think of burying them in any other place
than where their forefathers were laid, and therefore she was
obliged to bribe a serjeant to keep the fellows from digging up
the bodies again.</p>

<p>She and her poor children behoved to take to the hills, no
houses being left in the whole country about them. Mrs.
[<em>fol.</em> 375.]
Cameron said she never saw the Prince in his skulking, nor
knew not where he was.</p>

<h2>Tuesday's Afternoon, August 25th, 1747, in Edinburgh,
I had the favour of being introduced by
Miss <span class="smcap">Cameron</span> (daughter of Allan Cameron,
who died at Rome) to Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robertson, Lady
Inches</span>, who gave me the following particulars:</h2>


<div class="sidenote">25 Aug.
1747</div>

<div class="sidenote">18 April.</div>

<p>Some time before, and at the time of the battle, Lady Inches
was living with her family in Inverness, her husband being in
a dying condition, who was laid in his grave just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
cannonading began upon Drummossie Muir. On Friday after
the battle, April 18th, she went home to her house called the
Lees, within a mile or so of the field of battle. Upon the road
as she went along she saw heaps of dead bodies stript naked
and lying above ground. When she came to the Lees she
found sixteen dead bodies in the Closs and about the house,
which as soon as possible she caused bury. When she came
[<em>fol.</em> 376.]
into the Closs some of the sogers came about her, calling her
a rebel-bitch, and swearing, that certainly she behoved to be
such, or else so many of these damned villains would not have
come to get shelter about her house. Then pulling her by
the sleeve they desired her to come along with them, and they
would shew her a rare sight, which was two dead bodies lying
in the Closs with a curtain laid over them. They took off the
curtain and made her look upon the bodies, whose faces were
so cut and mangled that they could not be discerned to be
faces. They told her that the party who had been formerly
there had cut and mangled these villains, and had left them in
the house in their wounds; but when they themselves came
there they could not endure to hear their cries and groans, and
therefore they had dragged them out to the Closs and given
them a fire to their hinder-end. 'For,' said they, 'we roasted
and smoked them to death, and have cast this curtain taken
down from the side of one of your rooms over them, to keep
us from seeing the nauseous sight.' Lady Inches said she saw
the ashes and remains of the extinguished fire.</p>

<p>The house of the Lees was all pillaged, the doors of the
[<em>fol.</em> 377.]
rooms and closets, the outer doors, the windows, and all the
liming being broke down to pieces. The charter-chest was
broke open, and the papers were scattered up and down the
house; all her horses and cattle were taken away, though
Inches was not in the least concerned in the affair, save only
that he was a great Whig, and had a son out with the Duke
of Cumberland.</p>


<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>When she complained to David Bruce, he told her to go
through the camp and see if she could spy out any of her
furniture or goods among the sogers; and if she did, the
fellows should be seized upon, and she should have the satisfaction
of having them hanged. But seeing she could have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
reparation of damages she did not chuse to follow Mr. Bruce's
advice, and she declared she had never received one farthing
for the losses sustained.</p>

<p>On the day of the battle when the chace happened, one of
Inches's tenants and his son, who lived at the gate of the Lees,
[<em>fol.</em> 378.]
stept out at the door to see what was the fray, and were shot
by the red-coats, and fell down in one another's arms, the son
dying upon the spot; but the father did not die till the
Friday, the 18th, when Lady Inches went to see him, and he
was then expiring. Much about the same place they came
into a house where a poor beggar woman was spinning, and
they shot her dead upon the spot. In a word, Lady Inches
said they were really mad; they were furious, and no check
was given them in the least.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Upon the day of the battle, about nineteen wounded men
(but so as with proper care they might have been all cured)
got into a barn. Upon the Thursday (the day after the
battle) orders were issued out to put them to death. They
were accordingly taken out, and set up at a park wall as so many
marks to be sported with, and were shot dead upon the spot.
In the barn there was one of the name of Shaw, whom a Presbyterian
minister was going forwards to intercede for, because
[<em>fol.</em> 379.]
he was his particular acquaintance. But seeing the fury and
madness of the sogers, he thought fit to draw back lest he had
been set up amongst the poor wounded men as a mark to be
sported with in this scene of cruelty. Lady Inches said she
had forgot the minister's name, but she believed he was settled
at Castle Stewart; but she would not be positive about the
place of his abode, though she had got the particular story
from a sister of that minister, a married woman in Inverness.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>To confirm this the more, it is to be remarked that when
Provost Frazer and the other magistrates of Inverness (attended
by Mr. Hossack, the late provost) went to pay their
levee to Cumberland and his generals, the generals were
employed in giving orders about slaying the foresaid men
and other wounded persons. Mr. Hossack (the Sir Robert
Walpole of the place, under the direction of President Forbes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 380.]
and a man of humanity) could not witness such a prodigy of
intended wickedness without saying something, and therefore
making a low bow to General Hawley or General Husk, he
said, 'I hope your excellency will be so good as to mingle
mercy with judgment.' Upon this Hawley or Husk cried out
in a rage, 'Damn the rebel-dog. Kick him down stairs and
throw him in prison directly.'<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The orders were literally and
instantly obeyed, and those who were most firmly attached to
the Government were put in prison at the same time.</p>

<p>The country people durst not venture upon burying the
dead, lest they should have been made to bear them company
till particular orders should have been given for that purpose.</p>

<p>The meeting-house at Inverness [and all the bibles and
prayer-books in it were]<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> was burnt to ashes.</p>

<p>Lady Inches said it was really Loudon's piper that the stout
blacksmith killed, and that MacIntosh's house is seven or eight
miles from Inverness. When Lady MacIntosh was to be
brought a prisoner into Inverness, a great body of men, consisting
of several regiments, were sent upon the command, and
when she was leaving her own house the dead-beat was used by
[<em>fol.</em> 381.]
the drummers. In the commands<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> marching from and to
Inverness the horses trode many corpses under foot, and the
generous-hearted Lady MacIntosh behoved to have the mortification
of viewing this shocking scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;Before you receive this I hope to be in
Paradise. Not that I have the least right to expect it from
any merits of my own, or the goodness of my past life, but
merely through the intercession of my Saviour and Redeemer,
a sincere and hearty repentance of all my sins, and the variety
of punishments I have suffered since I saw you, and the death
which I shall die to-morrow, and which I trust in God will be
some small atonement for my transgressions; and to which I
think I am almost confident I shall submit with all the resignation
and chearfulness a truly pious Christian and a brave
souldier can wish.</p>

<p>I hope you will do my character so much justice (and, if you
[<em>fol.</em> 382.]
think proper, make use of this) as absolutely to contradict the
false and malicious reports, spread only by your enemies, in
hopes it might be of prejudice to you and your family, that I
was persuaded and compelled by you to engage, contrary to
my own inclinations. I send my tenderest love to all the dear
children, and beg Almighty God to bless you and them in this
world, and grant us all a happy meeting in that to come. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
shall leave directions with Charles to send them some trifle
whereby to remember me. Pray my excuse naming any particular
friends, for there is no end. But give my hearty service
and best wishes to all in general.</p>

<p>Mr. Syddal is very well, and sends his sincere compliments,
but does not chuse to write. He behaves as well as his best
friends can wish. My uncle has behaved to me in such a manner
as cannot be paralell'd but by yourself. I know I shall have your
prayers, which I am satisfied will be of infinite service to, dear
father, your dying but contented and truly affectionate son,</p>

<h2>Copy of some Paragraphs of a Letter to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Deacon's</span> Father, said to be written by the nonjurant
clergyman that used to visit Mr. <span class="smcap">Deacon</span>,
etc.</h2>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 283.] Their behaviour at divine worship was always with great
reverence, attention, and piety. But had you, sir, been present
the last day I attended them, your soul would have been
ravished by the fervour of their devotion.</p>

<p>From the time of their condemnation a decent chearfulness
constantly appeared in their countenances and behaviour, and
I believe it may truly be said that no men ever suffered in a
righteous cause with greater magnanimity and more Christian
fortitude. For the appearance of a violent death, armed with
the utmost terrour of pain and torments, made no impression or
dread upon their minds. In a word, great is the honour they
have done to the Church, the K[ing], and you, and themselves,
and may their example be imitated by all that suffer in the
same cause.</p>

<p>This short but faithful account of our martyred friends will,
I hope, sir, yield great consolation to you and poor Mrs.
Syddal. Poor, dear Charles bears in a commendable manner
[<em>fol.</em> 284.]
his great loss and other afflictions, and behaves like a man and
a Christian in all his actions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov<sup>r</sup>.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sister</span>,&mdash;I have endeavoured to take some small
time, from a much more immediate concern, to offer you a few
lines, and to let you know that this day I am to suffer, I think,
for my religion, my prince, and my country. For each of these
I wish I had a thousand lives to spend. The shortness of the
intimation will not allow me much time to write to you so
fully in my vindication for what I did that I know concerns you.
But I heartily repent of the bad advice I got even from men of
judgment and sense. And what I did by their advice in my
own opinion was no more than acknowledging I bore arms
against the present government, for my lawful, undoubted
prince, my religion, and country; and I thought by my plea to
procure some time longer life only to do service to my poor
[<em>fol.</em> 385.]
family, not doubting but yet in a short time that glorious
cause will succeed, which God of His infinite mercy grant.</p>

<p>I repent most heartily for what I did, and I merit this death
as my punishment, and I trust in the Almighty for mercy to
my poor soul. As I am very soon to leave this world, I pray
God to forgive all my enemies, particularly Mr. Gray,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> who
did me all the injury he could by suborning witnesses, and
threatening some which was my terror. Particularly there is
one poor man<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> to suffer with me that had an offer of his life
to be an evidence against me, which he rejected.</p>

<p>Much more I could say, but as my time is short, I now bid
my last adieu to my dear mother and you, my dear sister, and
I intreat you'll be kind to my dear wife and children; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
may all the blessings of Heaven attend you all. Live together
comfortably and you may expect God's favour. My grateful
acknowledgments for all your favours done and designed.</p>

<p>Remember me kindly to my Lady Caithness,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Sauchie, and
[<em>fol.</em> 386.]
his sisters, and all my friends and acquaintances. May the
Almighty grant you all happiness here, and eternal bliss hereafter,
to which bliss, I trust, in His mercy soon to retire; and
am for ever, dear sister, your affectionate brother,</p>

<div class="line">This prop and that successively decays.[<em>fol.</em> 400.]</div>
<div class="line">Strokes thicken; each alarm my heart dismays,</div>
<div class="line">Widow'd of ev'ry earthly flatt'ring joy.</div>
<div class="line">Sorrows on sorrows roll without alloy.</div>
<div class="line">My country bleeds, and in its ruines lie</div>
<div class="line">Thousands. My all's perhaps condemned to die.</div>
<div class="line">Amaz'd, o'erwhelmed, without one cheering ray,</div>
<div class="line">From those dread scenes, when shall I wing my way?</div>
<div class="line">To Thee, great God, I lift my fainting soul,</div>
<div class="line">Who fierce, devouring passions canst controul.</div>
<div class="line">Nature, convulsive, wrapt in furious forms,</div>
<div class="line">Calms at thy word. Contend shall mortal worms?</div>
<div class="line">If partial ill promotes the gen'ral good,</div>
<div class="line">Tho' nature shrinks, I kiss the angry rod.</div>
<div class="line">This, this alone, my spirits can sustain,</div>
<div class="line">That thou supreme o'er all the world dost reign.</div>
<div class="line">When I or mine, howe'er decreed to fall,</div>
<div class="line">Shall turn to dust, be our eternal all.</div>
<div class="line">Meanwhile, inspire with fortitude divine;</div>
<div class="line">In prisons and in death, thy face make shine.</div>
<div class="line">Thy smiles, O God! each trial can unsting,</div>
<div class="line">And out of gall itself can sweetness bring.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">O Liberty! O Virtue! O my Country!</div>
<div class="line">Tell me, ye wise, now sunk in deep despair,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">O strangers to the sorrows of the mind, [<em>fol.</em> 401.]</div>
<div class="line">The load of ills that oft afflicts mankind!</div>
<div class="line">One chain of woes another still succeeds.</div>
<div class="line">Our friends are martyr'd, and our country bleeds.</div>
<div class="line">Humanity's too weak these ills to bear;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></div>
<div class="line">Too plain a proof no happiness is here.</div>
<div class="line">Must we, content, slavery's curse endure,</div>
<div class="line">Nor bravely wish, nor once attempt a cure?</div>
<div class="line">Will rebel-murderers from blood refrain?</div>
<div class="line">Will corrupt statesmen liberty maintain?</div>
<div class="line">Will Britain clear her long-contracted scores</div>
<div class="line">On armies, fleets, for Hanover and whores?</div>
<div class="line">Will justice flourish, will our trade increase,</div>
<div class="line">Our fame grow greater, or our taxes less?</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Bid things impossible in our natures rise!</div>
<div class="line">Bid knaves turn honest, nay, bid fools turn wise!</div>
<div class="line">Bid France keep faith! Bid England show her zeal,</div>
<div class="line">And fight as well as wish to turn the scale!</div>
<div class="line">Bid sympathy forsake my joyless breast,</div>
<div class="line">Or miracles revive to give me rest!</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">In private life may happiness be found</div>
<div class="line">With those who only live, or who abound?</div>
<div class="line">Mark all estates, and shew me if you can,</div>
<div class="line">What's more precarious than the bliss of man.</div>
<div class="line">Amidst his joys, uncertain to possess,</div>
<div class="line">The fear of losing makes the pleasure less.</div>
<div class="line">Thus one's tormented with foreboding pain,</div>
<div class="line">Another's wretched thro' desire of gain.</div>
<div class="line">Some who enjoy health, peace, and competence,</div>
<div class="line">Are still unhappy; they've but common sense.</div>

<div class="line">The man of genius, brighter far and great, [<em>fol.</em> 402.]</div>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">In ev'ry station discontent we see;</div>
<div class="line">Each thinks his neighbour happier than he.</div>
<div class="line">Search the world o'er, 'tis doubtful if you find</div>
<div class="line">One man's condition fitted to his mind.</div>
<div class="line">Alternate real or imagin'd woes</div>
<div class="line">Disturb our life and all our joys oppose.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<div class="line">Nor can my muse the mournful tale avoid,</div>
<div class="line">What numbers zeal and brav'ry have destroy'd,</div>
<div class="line">The gen'rous, faithful, uncorrupted band,</div>
<div class="line">Design'd deliv'rers of a sinking land.</div>
<div class="line">Tho' good, unfortunate; oppress'd, tho' brave;</div>
<div class="line">See spiteful foes pursue them to the grave.</div>
<div class="line">Unshaken loyalty is all their crime,</div>
<div class="line">And struggling with their chains a second time.</div>
<div class="line">For this they suffer worse than traitor's fate,</div>
<div class="line">Condemned by knaves and furies of the state,</div>
<div class="line">In loathsome dungeons close confin'd they lie,</div>
<div class="line">To feel a thousand deaths before they die.</div>
<div class="line">At last these heroes must resign their breath,</div>
<div class="line">And close the scene with ignominious death.</div>
<div class="line">Thus ev'n the best their virtue has undone,</div>
<div class="line">And fix'd the slav'ry which they sought to shun.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">How then shall man attain the state of bliss?</div>
<div class="line">In t' other world he may, but not in this.</div>

<div class="line">Unjustly, therefore, some we happy call. [<em>fol.</em> 403.]</div>
<div class="line">More or less wretched is the fate of all.</div>

<h2>Satan transformed into an Angel of Light, or copy of
a Letter from Mr. <span class="smcap">Evidence Murray</span>, to his
nephew, <span class="smcap">Sir David Murray</span>, of seventeen or
eighteen years of age, in jayl in the city of
York, 1747.</h2>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 415.] The pleasure it gave me to hear that the king had been
graciously pleased to grant you a reprieve, was far greater than
the world could perhaps be willing to imagine for one in my
situation, as mankind is most apt to be concerned about their
own misfortunes. As I look upon it as my duty to give you
the best advice in my power, I would not fail to lay hold on
the liberty granted me to observe some few things which I hope
may be of service to you, when I may not have an opportunity
to advise you by word of mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>I must first observe that the grace shown you must have
proceeded entirely from a greatness of soul and a compassion
of your youth, as it was not in the least in your power to
atone for the offence. I know that you are brave, and I have
no doubt but you are generous, the latter being ever looked
upon as a concomitant of the former. Gratitude has always
[<em>fol.</em> 416.]
been esteemed one of the greatest virtues, and its opposite
regarded in so vile a light that the antient Spartans punished
it with death. Don't allow yourself to be too much elevated,
but consider coolly on the uneasiness you have felt, and thereby
judge of the favour you have received.</p>

<p>I hear there are zealots in the world who would willingly
make mankind believe that they act from principle alone, and
even would wish to die martyrs for their cause; and their lofty
notions are ready to gain even on those of riper years. But be
assured that at the bottom it is self-interest prevails. They
only intend to promote their own ambitious views without the
least regard to the welfare and happiness of others. Pull off
their mask and they appear in their native dress. Some such
you may meet with. But always remember the story of the
cat and the monkey; for depend upon it, when your hands are
[<em>fol.</em> 417.]
in the fire they will hug themselves on being safe. That there
ever have been such men is past dispute, and had there been
none such, that you and I would not have been in our present
situation is as undeniable. I shall now say a little to what I
know is a tender point, but nevertheless may be gently
touch'd.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>There are a certain set of men who can confine salvation to
their Church alone; but though I am no divine I cannot help
thinking it absurd to imagine that God Almighty made mankind
to damn nine out of ten, which must be the case, if their
maxim holds true. Our blessed Saviour died for both Jew
and Gentile. But I will not insist upon the subject, as you
may guess my meaning, and I hope will not fail to consider
seriously of it. I could, and indeed I incline to say a good
[<em>fol.</em> 418.]
deal more, but that I don't care to crowd too many thoughts
upon you all at once, so shall only further assure you that I
am sincerely,</p>

<p>Being now in a condition to make our way into this capital of
his Majesty's ancient kingdom of Scotland, we hereby summon
you to receive us, as you are in duty bound to do. And in
order to it we hereby require you upon receipt of this to

securing the peace and quiet of the city, which we are very
desirous to protect. But if you suffer any of the Usurper's
troops to enter the town, or any of the canon, arms, or amunition
now in it, whether belonging to the publick or to private
persons, to be carried off, we shall take it as a breach of your
[<em>fol.</em> 419.]
duty and a heinous offence against the king and us, and shall
resent it accordingly. We promise to preserve all the rights
and liberties of the city, and the particular property of every
one of his Majesty's subjects. But if any opposition be made
to us we cannot answer for the consequences, being firmly
resolved at any rate to enter the city, and in that case, if any
of the inhabitants are found in arms against us, they must not
expect to be treated as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Upon the magistrates receiving the above, the inhabitants

the town, and sent deputies out to the Prince to treat
with him, viz., Baillies Gavin Hamilton, John Yetts, and David
Inglis, and James Norrie, Deacon Convener, to whom the
Prince caused deliver the following answer.</p>

<p>His royal Highness the Prince Regent thinks his Manifesto
and the King, his father's, Declaration, already published, are a

sufficient capitulation for all his Majesty's subjects to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of with joy. His present demands are to be received into the
city as the son and representative of the king, his father, and
obeyed as such when he is there.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness supposes that since the receipt of his
letter to the provost and magistrates no arms or ammunition
have been suffered to be carried off or concealed, and will
expect a particular account of all things of that nature.</p>

<p>Lastly, he expects a positive answer to this before 2 o'clock
in the morning, otherwise he will find himself obliged to take
measures conform. By his Highness's command,</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>About the beginning of July 1746 one Garnet, a dragoon
in Lord Mark Ker's regiment, and son of one Garnet, a printer
at Sheffield, came to the printing house of William Sands
and Company at Edinburgh, and having been asked several
questions in relation to the battle of Culloden, said: That he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
himself was engaged there; that the orders they received were
<em>To make no prisoners</em>: That the reason of this severity was
that the Duke had got notice before the armies were engaged
that the rebels had given orders&mdash;To kill men, women, and
children of their enemies, without distinction, for eight days
[<em>fol.</em> 422.]
after the battle, in case victory should declare for them; that
he himself went to the field of battle the day after the engagement
in the forenoon; that on coming near it, he heard a
doleful noise; that on coming to the place he found that the
noise he had heard was several of the wounded rebels who had
crawled together were bemoaning one another's condition; that
in a short while after he saw some small parties of the king's
troops with officers on their head go through the field and
shoot the wounded rebels; that six or eight of the soldiers
fired together at different rebels, but did not receive the word of
command from their officers, though they stood by and saw the
service performed; that they went thro' the field thus; that some
of the rebels seemed pleased to be relieved of their pain by death,
while others begged of the soldiers to spare them, which,
however, was no ways regarded; that the soldiers employed in
this service were foot, so that he himself was only a spectator;
that soldiers went, a day or two after to the field and did the
[<em>fol.</em> 423.]
like; that such severity would not have been exercised against
a foreign enemy, and that at this time the French were treated
with great humanity, as they are said to be remarkably human
when conquerors; and that a written order was said to be
found in the pocket of one of the rebels after the battle agreeing
with the accounts above mentioned which the Duke had received
before the engagement. This dragoon who named and designed
himself as above seemed to be a discreet, ingenuous man.</p>

<p>An officer of the Broadalbine Militia (who was among those
who made openings in the stone walls, through which the
dragoons passed) being told the above, did not believe it, and
gave as his reason that a præmium having been given for every
gun and sword brought to the king's camp after the battle, the
men under his command were so busied in carrying guns and
swords from the field of battle to the camp that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
scarcely keep a sufficient number of them to do duty, and yet
[<em>fol.</em> 424.]
he never heard of the rebels being thus killed in cold blood,
which, being a thing very uncommon, he thought his men
could not miss to observe and to tell him of it. This gentleman
added, that he heard at that time of the order of the
rebels for giving no quarter; that a particular serjeant in
certain regiment was said to have it; that he asked it of him,
but was answered he heard another serjeant had it, and went
to two or three thus, and always found less reason to believe
there ever was any such order.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 429.] In answer to what you write about the Highland army
having not behaved with their usual bravery, or that some
of their principal officers had not done their duty, which
might be the occasion of their late misfortune, I must inform
you by all I can learn, the men showed the utmost eagerness
to come to action, nor did I hear of any one officer but
behaved well, so far as the situation and circumstances would
allow. The truth seems to be that they were overpowered
by a superiour force, and their field of battle was ill-chosen,
which gave the Duke of Cumberland great advantages, especially
in his canon and horse. Another misfortune they lay
under was a total want of provisions, so that they were reduced
to the hard necessity either of fighting an army a third
stronger, or to starve or disperse. As to what happened the
day of the battle and the preceding day, I shall let you know
[<em>fol.</em> 430.]
what I could learn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">15 April.</div>

<p>On the fifteenth, all those of the Highland army as were
assembled were drawn up in line of battle upon a moor south
from Culloden, facing eastwards. This was done early in the
morning, as it was known that the Duke of Cumberland was
come to Nairn the night before; but as he did not move
before mid-day, it was judged he would not march that day,
it being his birthday; and as his troops had made no halt
from the time he left Aberdeen, it was reasonable to think he
would give them a day's rest. It was then proposed to make
a night attack upon the Duke of Cumberland's army in their
camp, which, if it could be done before one or two o'clock in
the morning, might (though a desperate attempt) have had a
chance of succeeding. Several of the officers listened to this,
as they knew the Duke of Cumberland was much superiour to
the Highland army. The objection to it was that a great
many of the army had not as yet joined, particularly Keppoch,
the Master of Lovat, Cluny, Glengyle, the Mackenzies, and
[<em>fol.</em> 431.]
many of the recruits of Glengary and other regiments, which
were all expected in two or three days, and some of them
sooner; that if they should fail in the attempt and be repulsed,
it would not be easy rallying the Highlanders in the
dark; that if the Duke of Cumberland was alarm'd by any of
his patrollers, he might have time to put his army in order in
the camp (I suppose no spy should give timely notice), and
place his canon charged with cartouch shot as he had a mind,
and his horse might be all in readiness so as to pursue, if the
Highlanders had been beat off; and lastly, the difficulty of
making their retreat with perhaps a good many wounded men,
whom the Highlanders will never leave, be it possible to bring
them off. It is to be remarked that there was no intelligence
of the enemy's camp. Add to this, how fatiguing it would be
to march backwards and forwards twenty miles, and probably
be obliged to fight next day; nor could they make their
retreat safe and not be attacked before they joined the rest of
the army.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Prince was vastly bent for the night-attack,
[<em>fol.</em> 432.]
and said he had men enow to beat the enemy, whom
he believed utterly dispirited, and would never stand a bold
and brisk attack. The Duke of Perth, Lord John Drummond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
with others, seemed to wish it; and Lord George Murray,
Lochgary, with many others, were induced to make a fair trial
what could be done, though they were very sensible of the
danger should it miscary. They observed with much concern
the want of provisions. The men had only got that day a
biscuit each, and some not even that.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It was feared it would
prove worse next day, except they could take provisions from
the enemy; and they had reason to believe if the men were
allowed to disperse to shift for some meat (which many of
them would do if the army continued there all night), that it
would be very difficult to assemble them in the event of a
sudden alarm, which, considering the nearness of the enemy,
might very reasonably be supposed; and as they must have
layen that night in the muirs near Culloden, as they had done
the night before, they knew many of them would disperse
[<em>fol.</em> 433.]
without liberty to several miles distance for provisions and
quarters, and that it would be far in the day before they could
be assembled again; and as Keppoch came up and joined the
army that afternoon, they flattered themselves that the men
they had might do if they could have made the attack by one
or two in the morning, especially if they were undiscovered, as
they had great hopes they might. For having examined the
different roads, of which they had perfect intelligence from the
MacIntoshes, who lived in those very parts, they found they
could keep upon a muir the whole way so as to shun the houses,
and be a considerable way from the highroad that leads from
Inverness to Nairn. They also considered that in the event of
making the attack, should they even be beat off without the
desired success, they might before daybreak get back the length
of Culcarick,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which was very strong ground, and from thence by
a hill they could retire the whole way on the south side of the
water of Nairn, till they were joined by their friends whom
[<em>fol.</em> 434.]
they expected and by the stragglers. Nor did they believe
the enemy would follow them (suppose the Highlanders were
beat back) till it were good daylight, so as they could see
about them and send out reconnoitering parties to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
their falling into ambuscades and snares. And before all this
could be done, the Highland army might have reached Culcarick,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
and the hilly ground on the south side of the water
above-mentioned, where regular troops could not easily overtake
them, and where their canon and horse (in which their
greatest superiority consisted) would have been of little use.
That they found the Prince was resolved to fight the enemy
without waiting for the succours that were soon expected, and
without retiring to any strong ground, or endeavouring to
draw the Duke of Cumberland's army farther from the sea,
from whence he got all his provisions, that was brought about
in ships which sailed along it as his army marched near the
shore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16 April.</div>

<p>For these reasons the gentlemen and most others, if not
[<em>fol.</em> 435.]
all, who were spoke to upon the subject, seemed to think the
night attack might be attempted. But most of them thought
they were in very bad circumstances at any rate, and no
attempt could be more desperate than their present situation.
Lord George Murray, about mid-day, desired Brigadier
Stapleton and Colonel Ker to cross the Water of Nairn near
where the army was drawn up (not far from the place where
the battle was fought next day) to take a view of the hill
ground on the south side of the water, which to him appeared
to be steep and uneven, consequently much properer for
Highlanders, for the ground they were drawn up upon was a
large plain muir; and though in some places it was interspersed
with bogues and deep ground, yet for the most part it
was a fair field, and good for horse. After two or three hours,
they returned and reported that the ground was rough and
rugged, mossy and soft, so that no horse could be of use
there; that the ascent from the water side was steep; and
that there was about two or three places in about three or
[<em>fol.</em> 436.]
four miles where horse could cross, the banks being inaccessible.
They could not tell what sort of ground was at a greater
distance, but the country people informed them it was much
like the other. Upon this information Lord George Murray
proposed that the other side of the water should be the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for the army to be drawn up in line of battle next day;
but this was not agreed to. It was said it was like shunning
the enemy, being a mile further from the muir they were then
upon and at a greater distance from Inverness, which it
was resolved not to abandon, a great deal of baggage and
ammunition being left there. This was before the resolution
was taken of making the night attack. About seven at night
an incident happened which had liked to have stopt their
designed attempt, and upon it many were for giving it up as
impracticable. The thing was this. Numbers of men went
off to all sides, especially towards Inverness, and when the
officers who were sent on horseback to bring them back came
[<em>fol.</em> 437.]
up with them, they could by no persuasion be induced to
return again, giving for answer&mdash;they were starving; and
said to the officers they might shoot them if they pleased,
but they could not go back till they got meat. But the
Prince continued keen for the attack, and positive to attempt
it, and said there was not a moment to be lost; for as soon as
the men should see the march begun, not one of them would
flinch. It was near eight at night when they moved, which
could not be sooner, otherwise they might have been perceived
at a considerable distance, and the enemy have got account
of their march. Lord George Murray was in the van. Lord
John Drummond in the centre, and the Duke of Perth towards
the rear, where also the Prince was, having Fitz-James's horse
and others with him. Proper directions were given for small
parties possessing all the roads, that intelligence might not be
carried to the enemy. There were about two officers and
thirty men of the MacIntoshes in the front as guides, and
[<em>fol.</em> 438.]
some of the same were in the centre and rear, and in other
parts, for hindering any of the men from straggling. Before
the van had gone a mile, which was as slow as could be to give
time to the line to follow, there was express after express sent
to stop them, for that the rear was far behind. Upon this
the van marched still slower, but in a short time there came
aide-de-camps and other officers to stop them, or at least make
them go slower; and of these messages I am assured there
came near an hundred before the front got near Culraick,
which retarded them to such a degree that the night was far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
spent: for from the place the army began to march to
Culraick was but six miles, and they had still four long miles
to Nairn. It was now about one o'clock in the morning, when
Lord John Drummond came up to the van and told there
were several far behind; and, if they did not stop or go
slower, he was afraid the rear would not get up. In a little
[<em>fol.</em> 439.]
time the Duke of Perth came also to the front, and assured
that if there was not a halt the rear could not join. There
was a stop accordingly. Lochiel had been mostly in the van
all night, and his men were next the Athol men, who were in
the front. These two bodies made about twelve hundred men.
There were also several other officers that came up, there
being a defile a little way behind occasioned by a wall of the
wood of Culraick, which also retarded the march of those that
were behind. The officers, talking of the different places of
making the attack, said it was better to make the attempt
with four thousand men before daybreak, as with double the
number after it was light. Mr. O'Sullivan now having come
up to the front, and it being now evident by the time the
army had taken to march little more than six miles it would
be impossible to make the other part of the road&mdash;which was
about four miles&mdash;before it was clear day-light, besides the
[<em>fol.</em> 440.]
time that must be spent in making the disposition for the
attack, as it could not be done by the army in the line by
their long march. Mr. O'Sullivan said he had just then come
from the Prince, who was very desirous the attack should be
made; but as Lord George Murray had the van, and could
judge the time, he left it to him whether to do it or not.</p>

<p>There were several volunteers present, who had walked all
night in the front, such as Mr. Hepburn, Mr. Hunter, Mr.
Anderson, and others; and as the Duke of Perth, Lord John
Drummond, and other officers seemed to be much difficulted
what to resolve upon, Lord George Murray desired the rest
of the gentlemen to give their opinions, for they were all
deeply concerned in the consequence. It was agreed upon all
hands that it must be sun-rise before the army could reach
Nairn and form, so as to make an attempt upon the enemy's
camp; for one part was to have passed the water a mile above
the town, to have fallen upon them towards the sea-side. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 441.]
volunteers were all very keen to march. Some of them said
that the red-coats would be all drunk, as they surely had
solemnised the Duke of Cumberland's birth-day; and that,
though it were day-light, they would be in such confusion they
would not withstand the Highlanders.</p>

<p>This opinion shewed abundance of courage, for these gentlemen
would have been in the first rank had there been any
attack. But the officers were of different sentiments, as
severals of them expressed.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Lochiel and his brother said
they had been as much for the night attack as anybody could
be, and it was not their fault that it had not been done; but
blamed those in the rear that had marched so slow, and
retarded the rest of the army. Lord George Murray was of
the same way of thinking, and said, if they could have made
the attack, it was the best chance they had, especially if they
could have surprized the enemy. But to attack a camp that
was near double their number in day-light, when they would
[<em>fol.</em> 442.]
be prepared to receive them, would be perfect madness.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. John Hay came up and told the line was
joined. He was told the resolution was taken to return. He
began to argue upon the point, but nobody minded him. This
was the gentleman the army blamed for the distress they were
in for want of provisions, he having had the superintendency
of all these things from the time of Mr. Murray's illness, who
had always been extremely active in whatsoever regarded the
providing for the army. It was about two o'clock in the
morning (the halt being not above a quarter of an hour) when
they went back in two columns, the rear facing about, and the
van taking another way. At a little distance they had a view
of the fires of the Duke of Cumberland's camp; and, as they
did not shun passing near houses as they had done in
advancing, they marched very quick. Day-light began to
[<em>fol.</em> 443.]
appear about an hour after. They got to Culloden pretty
early, so that the men had three or four hours' rest. They
killed what cattle or sheep they could find; but few of them
had time to make anything ready before the alarm came of
the enemy's being upon their march and approaching. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
horse of the Prince's army had been all on such hard duty for
several days and nights before that none of them were fit for
patroling. At that time, Fitz-James's horse and several others
had gone to Inverness to refresh, so at first it was not known
whether it was an advanced party or the Duke of Cumberland's
whole army. However, the Highlanders got ready as quick
as possible, and marched through the parks of Culloden in
battalions (just as they chanced to be lying) to the muir on
the south side, facing eastwards, and about half a mile farther
back than where they had been drawn up the night before.
Lord George Murray proposed once more to pass the Water
of Nairn, as being the strongest ground, and much the fitter
[<em>fol.</em> 444.]
for Highlanders. Cluny, who was expected every moment,
was to come on that side; but it was not agreed upon for the
same reason given the day before. Lord George, speaking to
Mr. O'Sullivan, he told him that he was afraid the enemy would
have great advantage in that plain muir, both in their horse
and canon. But he, O'Sullivan, answered that he was sure
horse could be of no use, because there were several bogues and
morasses; but the event proved otherwise. Mr. O'Sullivan
drew up the army in line of battle (he being both adjutant
and quarter-master-general), and having shown every battalion
their place, the right closed to some inclosures near the Water
of Nairn, and the left towards the parks of Culloden. I
cannot justly tell what order they were drawn up in. There
had been some disputes a day or two before about their rank,
but nobody that had any regard for the common cause would
insist upon such things upon that occasion. Those who had
[<em>fol.</em> 445.]
gone off the night before and early that morning to Inverness
and other parts had now joined, and the Master of Lovat was
come up with a considerable recruit of his men. It was
observed that upon the right there were park walls, under
cover of which so many of the enemy could draw up and
flank the Highlanders. Lord George Murray, who commanded
that wing, was very desirous to have advanced and thrown
them down; but as this would have broke the line, and the
enemy forming their line of battle near that place, it was
judged by those about him too dangerous to attempt.</p>

<p>Both armies being fully formed, the canonading began on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
both sides, after which there was some small alteration made
in the disposition of the two armies by bringing troops from
the second line to the first, as both the ends advanced to out-flank
one another. The Highlanders were much galled by
the enemy's canon and were turned so impatient that they
[<em>fol.</em> 446.]
were like to break their ranks. Upon which it was judged
proper to attack, and orders were given accordingly. The
right wing advanced first as the whole line did much at the
same time. The left wing did not attack the enemy, at least
did not go in sword in hand, imagining they would be flanked
by a regiment of foot and some horse, which the enemy brought
up at that time from their second line or corps de reserve.
When the right wing were within pistol-shot of the enemy
they received a most terrible fire not only in front but also in
flank by reason of those that were posted near the stone walls,
notwithstanding of which they went on sword in hand, after
giving their fire close to the enemy, and were received by them
with their spontoons and bayonets. The two regiments of
foot that were upon the enemy's left would have been cut to
pieces had they not been immediately supported by other two
regiments from their second line. As it was, these two regiments
[<em>fol.</em> 447.]
(being Barrel's and that called Monroe's) had by their
own confession above two hundred men killed and wounded.
Two regiments of dragoons coming in upon the same side
entirely broke that wing of the Highlanders, and though three
battalions of the right of the second line were brought up and
gave their fire very well, yet the ground and everything else
was so favourable for the enemy that nothing could be done but
a total route ensued.</p>

<p>I am positively informed that the Highland army did not
consist of above seven thousand fighting men,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and that the
Duke of Cumberland's must have been ten or twelve thousand.
In the one army there were not above an hundred and fifty
horse, of which one half was of the regiment of Fitz-James. In
the other army they had eleven or twelve hundred.</p>

<p>When a misfortune happens people are apt to throw the
blame upon persons or causes, which frequently are either
[<em>fol.</em> 448.]
the effect of malice or ignorance, without knowing the real
springs and motives. Severals are of opinion that the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
attack could have been made, but I am convinced of the contrary
for the following reasons. The Highland army, when
they halted near Culraick, were not above five thousand men.
They had four miles to march, and part of them were obliged
to have made a considerable circumference so that it would
have been sun-rise before they could have made the attack.
The ground about Nairn where the enemy lay encamped was a
hard, dry soil, and plain muirs three miles round about except
where the sea intervened; the nearest strong and uneven
ground being the wood of Culraick. Let it be supposed the
Highlanders had made an attack in the broad day-light upon
an enemy double their number in their camp, who were well
refreshed with a day and two nights' rest, with plenty of all
kinds of provisions, with their canon pointed as they thought
[<em>fol.</em> 449.]
proper, their horse drawn up to their wish in a fine plain, what
must the consequence have been? What would have been
said of officers that led on men in such circumstances and such
a situation? Would it not have been certain death and destruction
of all those that made the attack? Would it not
have been said and justly said, Why go you on in such a
desperate attempt seeing it could not be done by surprize and
undiscovered as projected? Why not try the chance of a fair
battle by returning and being joined by the rest of the army
as well as by those who had withdrawn the night before, and
a great many others who were hourly expected; where also
they might have canon and choice of the field of battle? By
this means there was a fair chance, by others there was none.</p>

<p>As to the above-mentioned facts you may rely upon them.
I saw the Duke of Perth, the Duke of Athol, Lord John
Drummond, Lord George Murray, Lord Ogilvie, Colonel
Stewart of Ardshiel, Colonel Roy Stewart, Lord Nairn, and
several others, at Ruthven of Badenoch on the Friday two days
[<em>fol.</em> 450.]
after the battle, and they all agreed on the same things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.</div>

<p>One thing I must take notice of, that from the beginning of
the whole affair there never had been the least dispute<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
misunderstanding among the officers. Some find fault that
the night march was undertaken seeing there was not a certainty
of marching to Nairn time enough to make the attack before
day-light, as also that they had too few men.</p>

<p>In answer to this. It was not doubted when the march was
begun but that there would be abundance of time. Their
greatest precaution was not to be discovered. The Highlanders
had often made very quick marches in the night-time. The
French piquets I believe were in the rear and were not so clever
in marching, and the muir they went through was more splashy
than they expected, and they were obliged to make some turns
to shun houses, and there were two or three dykes that took
[<em>fol.</em> 451.]
up a good deal of time to pass. The guides though they knew
the ground very well, yet were not judges to tell what time it
would take to march the ten miles, as they were called, though
by reason of the indirect road, must be more. Notwithstanding
of all this I am persuaded most of the army (had not the
van been frequently stopt and retarded by repeated orders and
messages) would have been at Nairn by two o'clock in the
morning. As for the number of men, though not half that of
the enemy, they might very probably have succeeded in the
attempt had they made the attack undiscovered. Nothing is
more uncertain than the events of war. Night attacks are
most subject to disappointments. This march and counter-march,
to be sure, was, as things turned out, a great disadvantage.
It fatigued the men much, and a council of war
might have been obtained in which doubtless a resolution
would have been taken to chuse a more advantagious field of
[<em>fol.</em> 452.]
battle and perhaps postpon'd fighting for a day till the succours
that were coming up with the utmost expedition should join.
Councils of war were seldom held and were out of request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
from the time the army marched into England. I remember
but of two that were held, the one at Brampton in regard of
besieging Carlisle or going to attack General Wade. The
other was at Carlisle, where it was resolved to march forwards.
What happened at Derby was accidental by most of the officers
being at the Prince's quarters, and taking into consideration
their situation, they were all unanimous in advising the Prince
to retreat. I think there was but one council of war called
after they returned to Scotland, and that was near Crieff, the
[<em>fol.</em> 453.]
day after the retreat from Stirling, where there was some
difference of opinion, but it was at last agreed to march for
Inverness in two separate bodies, the one the Highland road,
and the other by the coast, severals at first being for the army
all going one road. The day of the battle of Falkirk the
officers were called on the field where the army was drawn up
betwixt Bannockburn and the Torwood, and all agreed immediately
to march to the enemy; also the retreat from
Stirling, it was advised by many of the principal officers,
particularly the clans. They drew up the reasons and sign'd
them at Falkirk three days before the retreat was made, the
chief of which was that a vast number of men had gone off
after the battle, and were not returned, and that the siege of
Stirling Castle was not advancing; they did not think it
advisable to fight in such circumstances.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 454.]
This letter has been much longer than I intended. But
before I conclude I must acquaint you that six weeks before
the battle of Culloden some officers proposed sending up meal
to several parts of the Highlands, and in particular to Badenoch,
that in the event of the Duke of Cumberland's army
marching towards Inverness before the army was gathered they
might retreat for a few days till they could assemble; or
if a misfortune should happen by a defeat there might be some
provisions in these parts. But this was reckoned a timorous
advice and rejected as such, though I have reason to believe
that the opinion of mostly all the Highland officers was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the same. There was no doubt the Highlanders could have
avoided fighting till they had found their advantages. In so
doing they could have made a summer campaign without
running the risque of any misfortune. They could have
marched through the hills to places in Aberdeenshire, Banffshire,
[<em>fol.</em> 455.]
the Merns, Angus, Perthshire, or Argyleshire by ways
that no regular troops could have followed them; and if the
regular troops had continued among the mountains they must
have been attended with great difficulties and expence. Their
convoys might have been cut off, and opportunities offered to
have attacked them with almost a certainty of success. And
though the Highlanders had neither money nor magazines
they could not have starved in that season of the year, so long
as there were any sheep or cattle to be had. They could also
have separated into two or three different bodies, got meal for
some days' provision, met again at a place appointed, and have
attacked the enemy where was least expected. They could
have marched in three days what would have taken regular
troops five. Nay, had these taken the high roads (as often
they would have been obliged to do upon account of their
[<em>fol.</em> 456.]
carriages) it would have taken them ten or twelve. In short,
they would have been so harrassed and fatigued, that they
must have been in the greatest distress and difficulties; and
at the long run probably been destroyed. At least, much
might have been expected by gaining of time. Perhaps
such succours might have come from France as would have
made the Highlanders to have made an offensive instead of a
defensive war. This I saw was the opinion of many of the
officers who considered the consequences of losing a battle.
They knew well that few of the Highlanders would join heartily
against them, as long as they continued entire, but would upon
a defeat. There was one great objection to this, that the Irish
officers, who were all as brave men and zealous in the cause as
possibly could be, and many of the low-country men, could not
endure the fatigue of a Highland campaign. As to the common
[<em>fol.</em> 457.]
soldiers that came from France there were not four hundred of
them remaining. They and their officers, even though a battle
was lost, had but to surrender and be made prisoners of war. It
was very different with the Scots, whose safety depended upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
their not venturing a battle without great probability of
success. But any proposition to postpone fighting was ill-received
and was called discouraging the army.</p>

<p>I have nothing further to add, but am, etc.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">17 Oct.
1747</div>


<p>[<em>fol.</em> 458.] John Hay, captain of the Custom House yacht at Air, came
to the house of James Renny, wine-cooper in Leith, about 8
o'clock at night, when the conversation turned pretty much
upon Miss Flora MacDonald, whom Captain Hay had seen
several times after she was made prisoner, as he had been
employed along with the ships and sloops of war, etc., in
executing the errands and designs of the government about the
west and north coast before the battle of Culloden, and after
that in searching for the Prince and his friends. Captain Hay,
asking about Miss MacDonald's welfare, said he could not help
being surprized how it came about that her stepfather, MacDonald
of Armadale, had never been taken up for that he had
done very much, and far more, than ever it was in the power
of Miss MacDonald to do. When it was asked what Armadale
had done, the captain's answer was in these or the like
words,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> 'General Campbell complained to me more than once,
that MacDonald of Armadale was the man that had misled him
when searching for the Young Pretender; and therefore,'
[<em>fol.</em> 459.]
added he, 'I cannot fail being surprized that Armadale was
never taken into custody.'</p>

<p>Miss Peggie Forbes, who had heard something of Armadale's
history, told the captain it was not for want of inclination and
searching on the part of the government that Armadale had
not been taken up, for that he was under a necessity, after
knowing himself to be suspected, to skulk and go out of the
way for some time.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

Copy of some Omissions in <span class="smcap">Donald MacLeod's</span>
Journal.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">21 Oct.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 460.] Donald MacLeod, having been long detained in and about
Edinburgh by the civilities and kindness of friends, was in my
room in the Citadel of Leith, along with James MacDonald,
joiner, upon Wednesday, October 21st, 1747, when Donald
was pleased to inform me that upon reflection, he found he had
forgot some few particulars in giving me his Journal, and
therefore he would now take the opportunity of giving me a
narrative of them. Accordingly I writ them down from his
own mouth.</p>

<p>[See vol. 2d, page 301,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> near the foot, the paragraph beginning
with June 14th.]</p>

<p>From the foot of the mountain of Coradale they set sail in
Campbell's boat still, and landed in the Island Ouia, at Benbicula,
where they stayed four nights. From thence the
Prince and O'Neil, with a guide, went to Rushness, where
Lady Clanranald was. Donald and O'Sullivan were left at
Ouia, where they abode two nights after the Prince had gone
off to Rushness by land. The third night after the Prince had
[<em>fol.</em> 461.]
been at Rushness, he got information that it was advisable he
should go back again to the place from whence he had come;
but he knew not well what to do, as the boats of the militia
had been all the time in the course between Ouia and Rushness.
Donald and O'Sullivan, hearing of the Prince's situation,
set sail under favour of the night, and brought the Prince off
from Rushness, steering their course from thence south again
back towards Coradale hill. But meeting with a violent
storm, and a very heavy rain, they were forced to put into
Uishness Point, two miles and an half north of Coradale. The
place they put up at in that night is called Achkirsideallich,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
a rock upon the shore, in a clift of which they took up their
quarters, the storm continuing for a whole day. At night the
enemy being within less than two miles of them, they set sail
again, and arrived safely at Ciliestiella, from whence they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
steered their course towards Loch Boisdale. But one on board
swore that there was a long-boat in their way, no doubt full of
[<em>fol.</em> 462.]
marines. Donald MacLeod was positive on the contrary, and
assured them that it was nothing else but a little rock in the
water, which he was formerly acquainted with, having the
appearance of a boat at some distance. But he could not
persuade them to take his opinion of the matter, and therefore
they steered back to Ciliestiella, and stayed there that night.
Next day they set out for Loch Boisdale, where they got the
disagreeable accounts of Boisdale's being made a prisoner, etc.,
and whereabouts they made their abode for about eight days.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>At the same time Donald told me that Boisdale was once a
whole night with the Prince upon Coradale,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and was very
merry with him; and desired me still to remark that if Boisdale
had not been prisoner, the Prince needed not to have left
the Long Isle at all.</p>

<p>Donald likewise told me that when in London he called for
his chiftain, who would not vouchsafe him so much as a look;
[<em>fol.</em> 463.]
and that one day spying him on the street of Edinburgh, he
ventured to make up to him to enquire about his welfare; but
his honour never minded honest Donald, and would take no
notice of him at all.</p>

<p>When I told Donald that I would write down an account of
this odd conduct in the Laird, he said, 'O na, lat him be.'
But I positively insisted upon it, and would not yield it to
Donald, remarking withal that I looked upon him as a great
honour to his chiftain, and that therefore he needed not have
behaved so to him as if he had been ashamed of him. To
which Donald modestly replied, 'Faith, sir, I hope he winna
say I am a disgrace to him.'</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 464.] <span class="smcap">Revd. Sir</span>,&mdash;I am to address you at this time on behalf of
William Baird, very misfortunate man, and now lying
prisoner under sentence of death in the jayl at Carlisle, and
every moment expecting to be transported with others that
are in the same situation with himself there. This poor man
went up to Carlisle in September last as an exculpatory evidence
for the late Revd. Mr. Lyon, who was execute at Penrith in
October last; but he no sooner appeared in Carlisle in this
capacity, than he was tried for high treason, and condemned to
die with the other prisoners that were tried, though he produced
in court a protection from an officer in Montrose, upon
the delivering up of his arms in terms of the Duke of Cumberland's
[<em>fol.</em> 465.]
order. But the judges had no regard to this, as they
wanted by all means to try and condemn this poor man, in
order to debar him from being evidence for Mr. Lyon, whom
they were to destroy at any rate. As this poor man is in great
misery just now, so I wish you would use your interest in order
to procure him some supplies of money from well-disposed persons,
which would come in good stead to him, as he is just now
in the most miserable condition imaginable, being destitute of
cloaths, linen, and everything else that is necessary for him to
have, and of bread too, of which he has but a scanty portion
every day, and such as keeps in life, and that is all. If you
can get any money collected for him, Mr. James Wright will
direct you as to the way and manner you are to remit to him.
This poor unlucky man has a just title to the regard of every
well-disposed person, as he has resigned his own life to preserve
Mr. Lyon's; and if he had not done so, he would not have
[<em>fol.</em> 466.]
been in so miserable a condition as he is just now. He is a
married man, and has a wife and children here, which have no
subsistence but from myself. I pity their case very much, as
every good person must. May God raise up friends for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that are in their situation.&mdash;I am, Reverend Sir, your most

<h2>Copy of a Return to the above Letter, wherein a
character of honest <span class="smcap">Donald MacLeod</span>.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">21 Oct.
1747</div>



<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Your lordship may be justly surprized at me
having been honoured with yours of September 8th, without
making any return to it before this time. But to tell the
truth, as I had a view of this bearer, I delayed writing till I
could do it with a good grace. And sure I am I could never
[<em>fol.</em> 467.]
do it with a better one than at present, when I gladly embrace
the opportunity of affording your lordship the happiness to
salute one of the first men in the world.</p>

<p>I know, my Lord, you feel a sensible pleasure beyond many
in the world in conversing with worthies, men of rigid virtue
and integrity, and such indeed this man is.</p>

<p>Know then, my Lord, that this will be put into your hands
by the renowned <span class="smcap">Scots Palinurus</span>, Donald MacLeod, tenant at
Gualtergill, in the Isle of Sky, that most faithfull and honest
steersman of the eight-oar'd boat from the continent to the
Isles of Benbicula, South Uist, Lewis, etc., etc., etc., and who
had the Prince among his hands for about ten weeks after the
battle of Culloden. While a prisoner on board a ship he went
through an uninterrupted series of the greatest hardships and
severities for several months together. In a word, he was reduced
[<em>fol.</em> 468.]
to the lowest ebb of misery, and had the mortification of
seeing others dying about him like rotten sheep. But his gray
hairs (by a remarkable blessing of Heaven) have survived the
trials of adversity, while many younger and in appearance
much stronger, submitted to the fate of a lingring death.</p>

<p>Although his history be most extraordinary in all the
several instances of it, yet, my Lord, when he arrived here from
London, he had not wherewith to bear his charges to Sky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
where he has a wife and children (under the Laird of Macleod)
whom he has now been absent from for nineteen or twenty
months. Something has been done for him in and about Edinburgh,
but far from what his merit justly entitles him to, and
what his circumstances really call for. So many and frequent
are the demands that have been made, that I must frankly own
I was turned quite bankrupt in applications before I had the
honour of your Lordship's letter; so that it was altogether
[<em>fol.</em> 469.]
out of my power, though my inclination was great, to make
anything for poor William Baird, whose affecting history and
character were no strangers to me.</p>

<p>Take a view, my Lord, of this truly noble (though poor)
worthy in this single point&mdash;that he had the courage and
integrity of heart to despise the tempting bait of <em>thirty thousand
pounds sterling</em>, and not only so, but that in spite of the infirmities
attending the hoary head he struggled through as great
[<em>fol.</em> 470.]
dangers<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and difficulties of life for the preservation of etc., as
it is in the power of the most fertil fancy to paint; and then
I leave it to your lordship to draw the immortal character of
this amiable instance of heroic virtue.</p>

<p>I dare venture to say that no man of bowels can hear honest
Donald's interesting story without a mixture of joy and pain,
and even without shedding tears. Well do I know all the
several parts of it, and the more I think upon it, to the
greater height is my admiration raised of the wondrous good
man.</p>

<p>He has a large silver snuff-box which serves as an excellent
medal of his history, to which I refer your lordship after asking
your forgiveness for this too long letter. But while I would
fain flatter myself with the hopes I am giving you pleasure, I
indulge a self-satisfaction, for I could dwell upon the subject.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to know when this reaches your lordship's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
hands, for I will be sorry if it should happen to be of an old
[<em>fol.</em> 471.]
date before it is delivered.</p>

<p>That God Almighty may bless and reward your lordship
with all happiness both here and hereafter, for the many
seasonable instances of compassion and relief you have shewn to
the necessitous and deserving, is the hearty and earnest prayer
of, My Lord, Your lordship's very much obliged and most
humble servant,</p>

<div class="sidenote">28 Oct.
1747</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 473.] <span class="smcap">My very dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your kind and obliging letter I
received yesterday, together with the present you sent me,
upon which I put a very great value, and for which I most
heartily thank you.</p>

<p>I have written to you and Kingsburgh at some length by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Donald Macleod, who left Edinburgh upon Friday last, the
23d instant. But as this will come soonest to hand, I chuse to
repeat some things.</p>

<p>It has been suggested to me by a very judicious person that
it would be advisable in Kingsburgh to deliver up a certain
original letter into some sure hand for the preservation of it
But this must be altogether left to the judgment and discretion
of Kingsburgh himself. However, at anyrate, I earnestly desire
to have an exact copy of the letter, and I hereby engage that
[<em>fol.</em> 474.]
it shall be as great a secret as at this moment.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly desirous to have the brave and the honest
Armadale's account from his own mouth,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> which I hope he will
chearfully give. Let it be as exact and circumstantial as
possible. Is it possible to procure Boisdales account in his
own words? for I wish much to have that too. You see I am
very greedy, and indeed no wonder; for these things would be
of inexpressible use in future ages.</p>

<p>If you think of being soon in this country (as you seem
to suggest in your letter), then you may bring along with you
all the several accounts you can possibly collect, and remember
to favour me with the happiness of the first visit. But if
you resolve not to be soon here, then be so good as to
embrace the first sure opportunity that comes in your way
and transmit to me all that you have gathered together among
good friends.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 475.]
I make an offer of my best wishes to the worthy family of
Raaza, to Kingsburgh and his lady, and to Armadale and his
concerns.</p>

<p>That all happiness may ever attend you and Mrs. Macleod
is the hearty and earnest prayer of, My Dear Sir, Your most
affectionate friend and very humble servant,</p>

<h2>
<span class="smcap">Narrative</span> of a Conversation betwixt Captain <span class="smcap">John
Hay</span> and me, <span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">7 Nov.
1747</div>

<p class="head">
<em>Leith, Saturday, November 7th, 1747.</em>
</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 479.] I dined in the house of Mrs. Seaman at the foot of the
Kirkgate, with John Hay, captain of the Custom-House yacht
at Air, when the conversation turned much upon the dangers
and distresses the Prince behoved to undergoe in his skulking
and wandering from place to place after the battle of Culloden.</p>

<p>Captain Hay asked if it was not one of the name of MacLeod
that went to Stornoway in the Lewis upon the business
of engaging a ship, with a design to take off the Prince and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the few that were then with him? I told him it was Donald
MacLeod, an old man of sixty-eight years of age, and who had
been along with the Prince for nine or ten weeks after the
battle of Culloden. 'That project,' said the Captain, 'happened
to miscarry by being discovered, and I have reason to
think that the discovery was owing to an information given by
a Presbyterian minister.' Upon this I gave the Captain an
account of this affair (to the best of my remembrance) as I
[<em>fol.</em> 480.]
had got it from the mouth of Donald MacLeod, viz., that a
Presbyterian preacher in one of the Uists had writ a letter to
a friend in the Harris, who then writ a letter to a Presbyterian
preacher in the Lewis, upon which the people of the Lewis
conveened at Stornoway to the number of some hundreds, etc.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>To this the Captain replied that he had good reason to
assure me that that indeed was the matter of fact. 'For,'
added he, 'as I was cruizing along with the rest at that time
I had an opportunity of knowing how the different informations
came about.'</p>

<p>I told him I was exceedingly glad to have his account of the
matter to support and confirm Donald Macleod's own representation
of it, because that Donald had been reproached by
severals for having got drunk;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and in his cups for having
discovered to some one acquaintance or other the real design
for which he had hired the ship, and this acquaintance was
said to have blown the whole project. Captain Hay said he
did not believe one word of all that, but that the true state
[<em>fol.</em> 481.]
of the case was above represented, and that the Prince
would have been on board with his few attendants that very
night when the discovery was made, had he not met with
that unexpected disappointment.</p>

<p>Captain Hay asked if I could inform him of the day when
the Prince set out from the Isle of Sky to the mainland.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
I told him it was July 5th, and likewise remarked to him what
difficulty I had with Captain Malcolm MacLeod to adjust this
matter of a precise date.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> 'Surely then,' said the Captain, 'we
behoved to be very near the Prince in his crossing the ferry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the mainland.' I told him I did not doubt that at all, and then
I gave him an account (as exactly as I could) of that narrative
given me by Mrs. MacDonald of Kingsburgh, and afterwards
confirmed to me by Malcolm MacLeod himself,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> anent
the Prince's desiring Malcolm MacLeod to have no fear, for
that the wind would soon change, and make the ships of war,
[<em>fol.</em> 482.]
then in view upon the coast of Sky, steer a direct contrary
course, so that it would not be in their power to come near
him at that time. At this Captain Hay, with an asseveration,
assured the company that that was literally true; for
that when they were sailing along the coast of Sky with a
pretty brisk gale, all of a sudden the wind changed upon
them and forced them to sail a direct contrary course. He
said he remembered nothing better.</p>

<p>Here I remarked that some would be ready to attribute this
in the Prince to the second sight or some such uncommon
supernatural cause; but that for my own part I believed
there were some who could tell a little time before that the
wind would blow from this or the other point of the compass,
being in the use of making observations in that way.
Captain Hay replied that sailors and others who dealt in
observations of that kind could exactly enough tell from the
[<em>fol.</em> 483.]
motion of a cloud, or the like, when the wind would veer
about to this or the other quarter; and from what had been
said he remarked that the Prince behoved to have skill in that
way. I then told the company that Malcolm MacLeod had
said that he never knew a man in all his life that had such
a firm and steady trust in the providence of God as the
Prince was remarkably blessed with.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The conversation happening to turn upon the subject of Rorie
MacKenzie's death, it was said that it was certain enough that
Rorie MacKenzie had been taken by a party of Cumberland's
army for the Prince, and that he had been actually butchered
by them; but as to the particular circumstance of the
butchery, that was an affair not so easily to be discovered. Here
I told the company that particular story given me by Kingsburgh
anent the officer's talking to him at Fort Augustus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 484.]
about the young Pretender's head.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Upon this Captain Hay
said that in visiting his friends lately in the south country he
had discovered a story well worth the remarking, and the more
so because it had come from the Duke of Cumberland's own
mouth. The Captain informed the company that he had met
with a gentleman in the south who told him that when the
Duke of Cumberland was on his way from the north to Berwick
he had gone to that town to wait upon him, that accordingly
he paid his court to him, and after he had done so, he
asked his highness if he had entirely finished the whole affair,
and left the country in peace. The Duke answered he had
done so. Then the gentleman asked what was become of the
Pretender's oldest son? The Duke replied that he had taken
care to leave such orders behind him that the Pretender's
[<em>fol.</em> 485.]
eldest son would never be more heard of. Captain Hay said
that as he had this particular narrative from the gentleman's
own mouth, it deserved the more credit, for he could depend
upon the truth of it; but he did not chuse to name the
gentleman.</p>

<p>Captain Hay was pleased to tell the company that when
General Campbell came to the Laird of Clanranald's house in
search of the Prince (so the Captain named him during the
whole conversation) Lady Clanranald happened not to be at
home, but that she came home pretty soon after. The General
told the lady that he was to dine with her, and then began to
interrogate her where she had been? Lady Clanranald
answered that she had been visiting a sick child at some
distance.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The General asking the name of the child, the lady
made no stop in giving a name, and said likewise that the child
was much better than formerly it had been; and she conversed
all along with the General in a very easy, unconcerned way.
[<em>fol.</em> 486.]
Here the Captain observed that the visiting of the sick child
was only a mere pretence the better to cover the real business
the lady had been employed about, for afterwards it was discovered
that Lady Clanranald at that time had actually been
with the Prince.</p>

<p>I could not fail remarking to Captain Hay that Lady Clanranald's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
acquitting herself so exactly and wisely in the Prince's
preservation was something very singular, and the more extraordinary
that (as I had been informed) she happens frequently
not to be so well in her health, and therefore (one would be
apt to imagine) quite unfit to manage a point of so much
delicacy and danger. The Captain answered that Lady Clanranald's
conduct in that affair, all things considered, was very
extraordinary indeed.</p>

<p>After giving several very remarkable instances of the miseries
and dangers the Prince had been exposed to in his wanderings,
I begged leave to ask at Captain Hay what notions he
[<em>fol.</em> 487.]
would entertain of those folks in and about Edinburgh (people
of no mean sense and discretion in the common affairs of life)
who when certain accounts had come of the Prince's arrival in
France were pleased to say: 'O these Jacobites are strange
bodies, who attribute the preservation of their Prince to the
providence of God alone, when Providence could have no hand
in it at all, seeing the Duke of Cumberland and his army were
not willing to take him, but, on the contrary, avoided the laying
hands on him when they might have done it.' At this Captain
Hay held up his hands and declared his amazement that any
such expression could ever proceed out of the mouth of any
person whatsomever, and asked seriously if there were any persons
that could have the impudence to talk so? I assured
him there were such persons as had actually used the above
expressions, or words to the same purpose, and that they could
[<em>fol.</em> 488.]
be named. He said he was indeed surprised to hear the thing,
considering the strict searches that had been made for the person
of the Prince, and the many narrow escapes he had made.
And, moreover, that it was well known in the army that when
any officers happened to bring prisoners into the camp in the
north, and after the report being made at the headquarters,
the Duke of Cumberland used to be in a very bad humour, and
to express himself in these words: 'These officers don't know
their duty.'</p>

<p>The whole conversation went easily on, and lasted till between
four and five o'clock at night.</p>

<p>There were present who witnessed the above conversation,
Richard Seaman, baxter in Leith, John Hay, piriwig maker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
in Edinburgh, Mrs. Bettie Seaman and Mrs. Ellie Kendal.
Mrs. Seaman herself went from the company pretty soon after
dinner to look after her business, so that she witnessed but a
small part of the conversation. John Hay, piriwig maker,
[<em>fol.</em> 489.]
declared his being very much pleased with being present at such
a long and so particular a conversation upon the dangers and
distresses of the Prince, and at the narrating some of the more
moving and interesting parts he was so much affected that he
shed tears. He frankly owned that he had never heard so much
of the matter in all the several companies he had formerly
resorted to where this extraordinary and affecting history
happened to be the subject of conversation.</p>

etc.,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> taken from the month of <span class="smcap">Æneas MacDonald</span>
(a banker in Paris, and brother of

custody in London, by Dr. <span class="smcap">Burton</span> of York,
who was taken up, upon suspicion, the 30th of
November 1745, and confined till the 11th of
March following in York Castle, and was from
thence removed to a messenger's house in
London, in whose custody he remained till
March 25th, 1747, being in all sixteen months
wanting only five days.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">1745.
June.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 490.] After the Prince had settled everything for his subsequent
undertaking, the gentlemen who were to accompany him on his
voyage took different routs to Nantz, the place appointed to
meet at, thereby the better to conceal their design. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
their residence there they lodged in different parts of the town,
and if they accidentally met in the street or elsewhere they
took not the least notice of each other, nor seemed to be any
[<em>fol.</em> 491.]
way acquainted, if there was any person near enough to observe
them. During this time, and whilst everything was preparing
to set sail, the Prince went to a seat of the Duke of Bouillon
and took some days' diversion in hunting, fishing, and shooting,
amusements he always delighted in, being at first obliged to it
on account of his health. By this means he became inured to
toil and labour, which enabled him to undergo the great
fatigues and hardships he was afterwards exposed unto.</p>

<p>From this place he went to a seat of the Duke of Fitz-James,
seemingly upon the same errand, and thence at a proper time
went in disguise directly on board the ship lying in the Loire,
being the river which goes immediately from Nantz to the sea.
[<em>fol.</em> 492.]
Here he found eight gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> above hinted at ready to
accompany and assist him in his expedition. They were the
Marquis of Tullibardine, alias Duke of Athol, Sir John MacDonald
(a French officer), Mr. Æneas MacDonald (a banker in
Paris), Mr. Strickland, Mr. Buchanan, Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Mr. O'Sullivan, and Mr. Kelly. To these I may add a ninth,
viz., Mr. Anthony Welch, the owner of the ship which carried
the Prince. He (this last) staid on the coast of Scotland about
three weeks, and did the Prince considerable service.</p>

<p>Here it will not be amiss to give some short account of the
above-mentioned attendants.</p>

<p>The Duke of Athol was made prisoner in Scotland, having
surrendred himself (as was given out by our lying newspapers)
to Mr. Buchanan of Drumakill, a Justice of Peace. But the
real matter of fact is that Drumakill, in his own house, basely
betrayed the Duke when he thought himself safe under the
protection of Drumakill's roof, having got assurances to that
purpose. To confirm the truth of this, Drumakill is so much
[<em>fol.</em> 493.]
despised for this breach of all the laws of hospitality and
honour that the gentlemen in the neighbourhood and in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
places of Scotland where Drumakill is known will not be seen
in his company, nor will they converse with him. From
Drumakill's house the Duke of Athol was carried to the Castle
of Dumbarton, the latter end of April 1746, whence he was
removed to Edinburgh, where he remained till the 13th of
May, and then was put on board the <em>Eltham</em> man-of-war in
Leith Road, and conveyed to the Tower of London, June 21st,
where he died on the 9th of July, and was there buried July
the 11th, 1746.</p>

<p>Sir John MacDonald, a French officer, surrendred himself
prisoner of war at Inverness upon the day of Culloden battle.
He was suffered to go out upon his parole amongst other French
officers at Penrith. He is a man of no extraordinary head as
a councillor.</p>

<p>Mr. Æneas MacDonald, a banker in Paris, surrendred himself
to General Campbell upon terms which, however, were not
[<em>fol.</em> 494.]
performed. He was committed to Dumbarton Castle, whence
he was conducted to Edinburgh Castle under a strong guard
the latter end of August 1746; and the week after, in the same
manner, was conveyed to the Duke of Newcastle's office at
Whitehall, London, and immediately committed into the
custody of a messenger. One day when he was concerting a
jaunt to Windsor with Miss Flora MacDonald, he was by order
taken out of the messenger's hands and committed to Newgate,
and thence to new prison in Southwark. All the time the
Prince was in Paris he lodged at Mr. Æneas MacDonald's
house.</p>

<p>Mr. Strickland died at Carlisle when it was possessed by the
Prince's army.</p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan, Sir Thomas Sheridan, Mr. O'Sullivan, and
Mr. Kelly made their escape into France.</p>

<p>The first of these, Mr. Buchanan, upon the intended invasion
at Dunkirk in 1743 was sent into England, and upon his return,
in attempting to get to Calais or Dunkirk, was taken prisoner.
[<em>fol.</em> 495.]
He made a plausible story, and going by a feigned name, pretending
great loyalty, etc., he artfully imposed upon one
Captain Aires, who was then going into Flanders with some
orders from the government, a person who has signalized himself
very much upon a late occasion, though not in his profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
as a soldier, yet as an evidence at St. Margaret's Hill in
Southwark, etc. etc. etc. This very man, perceiving Mr.
Buchanan understood French, and knew several of the French
officers, proposed making use of him as a spy in Flanders, which
Mr. Buchanan readily embraced, as it gave him a safe conveyance
out of British dominions. Accordingly he was conducted to
Ostend by Captain Aires, who was greatly surprized and no
less chagrin'd to find his fellow-traveller so well known there,
and to be the very man he had particular orders to find out, if
possible, and to secure him, at the time when Mr. Buchanan
had the address to deceive him. After this discovery Aires
[<em>fol.</em> 496.]
never offered to make any farther use of Mr. Buchanan, neither
could he detain him there. Mr. Buchanan was many years
assistant to Mr. Æneas MacDonald at Paris.</p>

<p>The second of these, Sir Thomas Sheridan, was tutor to the
young hero, whom he attended through most of his travels.
His master had a real and, I may say, filial affection for him,
which indeed was mutual, no man having his pupil's interest
more at heart than Sir Thomas. He got safe to France.
From that he went to Rome, where he waited upon his pupil's
father, who reprimanded him for persuading his son to undertake
such an expedition without better grounds. This reproof
so far affected Sir Thomas that he fell ill and died of grief.</p>

<p>The third of these, Mr. O'Sullivan, an Irishman, is a remarkable
man, of whom the world has been greatly deceived, whether
we look upon him as a soldier, a councillor, or for honesty
and integrity.</p>

<p>The fourth and last of these is the same Mr. Kelly who was
so many years confined in the Tower upon a suspicion of having
[<em>fol.</em> 497.]
had a hand in the famous plot of Dr. Atterbury, bishop of
Rochester. Mr. Kelly's chief employment was to go betwixt
his young master in Scotland and the French ministry, with
some of whom he was very intimate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22 June.</div>

<p>On Saturday the 22d of June 1745, the gentlemen (of whom
the above short account is given) being all incog. to the crew,
set sail out of the river Loire for Bellisle on board a vessel of
110 tons, called <em>La Doutelle</em>, carrying 16 guns, and commanded
by Captain Durbe; having first sent expresses from Nantz to
the young gentleman's father at Rome, to the king of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and the king of Spain, acquainting them with the expedition,
and desiring the two last to send armes, ammunition, and
money to Scotland, which request was in part complied with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23 June.</div>

<p>On the 23d, being next day, they anchored at Bellisle,
where they continued till the 4th of July waiting for the
<em>Elizabeth</em>, their convoy, a French ship of war of 64 guns and
about 500 men, commanded by Captain D'oe or D'eau.
[<em>fol.</em> 498.]
During the stay at this island, the Prince took great delight
in fishing. The better to conceal himself, he never would be
shaved from his leaving Nantz to his arrival in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 July.</div>

<p>Next morning, being the 5th of July, both ships set sail with
a fair wind, which continued so till the 7th, when it blew a
brisk gale; but the next day was a dead calm. On the 9th,
being in the latitude of 47 degrees 57 minutes north, and
west from the meridian of the Lizard 39 leagues, they descryed
a sail to windward, which proved to be a British man of war
of 58 guns called the <em>Lyon</em>, Captain Brett, commander, which
immediately bore down upon them. About three o'clock in
the afternoon they found what she was, and prepared to engage
her, having both of them hoisted French colours and shortened
sail. By 4 o'clock they were within two miles of each other,
and at 5 the engagement began.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9 July.</div>

<p>Upon the Frenchmen's first discovering a sail, a council of
war was held by the commander, etc., of the <em>Elizabeth</em> on
board the <em>Doutelle</em>, along with the passengers and her officers,
wherein it was agreed, if no more sail appeared, that the
[<em>fol.</em> 499.]
<em>Elizabeth</em> should engage her, but should reserve her fire till she
was so near the <em>Lion</em> as to stand the chance of all her guns
having effect, and then to give her a whole broadside; and if
the <em>Lion</em> did not sink, to close in with her and board her
directly, while the <em>Doutelle</em> should attack and assist her in
that, not being able to engage so heavy mettle as the <em>Lion</em>
would carry, but with her small arms would be of great use at
close fighting. Accordingly, both ships were prepared to
engage as agreed upon.</p>

<p>The <em>Lion</em>, being to windward, bore down upon the <em>Elizabeth</em>,
and began the engagement at some distance. The <em>Elizabeth</em>
followed the directions of the council of war, and received the
<em>Lion's</em> shot several times in hopes of putting the plan laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
down into execution. But finding the <em>Lion</em> not only had
the advantage of the wind, but that the British sailors worked
her better than the Frenchmen did the <em>Elizabeth</em>, Captain D'oe
[<em>fol.</em> 500.]
then found he could not accomplish his designs, and therefore
engaged at a distance; but still tried to get as close to the
<em>Lion</em> as possible.</p>

<p>The <em>Elizabeth</em>, being thus disappointed of attempting to
board the <em>Lion</em>, rendred all the assistance intended her by the
<em>Doutelle</em> of no effect, she being too small a vessel to contend
with the <em>Lion's</em> greatest guns; and therefore, when her
commander, Captain Durbe, found he could not assist the
<em>Elizabeth</em>, he drew off to a greater distance to avoid being
sunk till a more convenient opportunity might offer. This
gave those on board the <em>Doutelle</em> both time and leisure to
observe the management and behaviour of both ships.</p>

<p>They fought with equal bravery for several hours, but the
British sailors showed their superior skill and dexterity, which
were highly praised by all on board the <em>Doutelle</em>, as well French
as Scotch men; for, though the <em>Elizabeth</em> had more men, yet
they could not work her so well, nor fire so often as the <em>Lion</em>
did.</p>

<p>The engagement continued thus till after 9 o'clock, when
[<em>fol.</em> 501.]
the <em>Lion</em> began to abate of her fire, and, as far as she could, to
make a running fight, discharging only now and then a gun.
Then the advantage turned to the <em>Elizabeth's</em> side, her rigging
not being so much damaged as the <em>Lion's</em>, though she had
more men killed; and she now approached nearer and nearer
the <em>Lion</em>, who, finding she could not escape, fired a gun and
immediately struck. The <em>Elizabeth</em>, not going instantly up to
board her, but rather slacking her pace, encouraged the <em>Lion</em>
to set up her colours again. The reason of this behaviour of
the <em>Elizabeth</em> was owing to the death of both Captain D'oe
and his brother, who were killed by the last shot from the
<em>Lion</em>. This accident, when least expected, and there being
but one lieutenant left to command the <em>Elizabeth</em>, obliged him
to drop sail and to wait for the <em>Doutelle</em>, who, finding what
had happened to the <i>Lion</i>, was making all the sail she could to
[<em>fol.</em> 502.]
come up to the <em>Elizabeth</em>, which was soon accomplished, and a
council of war was held immediately upon what should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
done. It was herein agreed that, as it was ten o'clock, and
would be some time before they could get up to the <i>Lion</i>, who
was making all the haste she could to reach England, they
might be in danger of falling in with some other English
man of war, and be obliged to engage in the bad condition the
ship was in, and then must inevitably be either taken or sunk;
and, moreover, would be so much farther from the French
coast that, were they to spy a sail, they would not have time
to get into any harbour to avoid being taken. Therefore, it
was thought proper to desist from pursuing the <em>Lion</em>, she
being by this time out of sight. It was then asked if the
<em>Elizabeth</em> was in a condition to proceed in her intended
voyage, when her new commander answered in the negative;
for, as he could not refit her at sea for another engagement, it
would not therefore be safe to hazard their being sunk or
taken, more especially as so many British men of war and
[<i>fol.</i> 503.]
privateers were cruizing at sea, and as he had near 200 men
killed and wounded. They then determined to return to
Brest. Some of the passengers of the <em>Doutelle</em> endeavoured to
prevail upon the Prince to return also till another convoy
could be prepared, or the same could be refitted. To this he
would not consent, but resolved to proceed on his voyage.</p>

<p>The <em>Elizabeth</em>, though a French man of war, was sent out as
convoy to the <em>Doutelle</em> by one Mr. Walter Rutlets, an Irishman,
and a merchant at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>As it may seem odd that a subject could send out a man
of war as a convoy without the king's knowledge where she
was going, it is incumbent upon me to explain the nature of
such an undertaking. I must therefore remark that when any
of the French king's men of war are in harbour and fit for use,
but not going upon any immediate business of the king's own,
any of his subjects may upon proper application have her,
and send her out on a cruize for the time granted, he (the
[<em>fol.</em> 504.]
subject) paying the men's wages during that time. By this
means the King of France annoys his enemies without being
at the expence of the men, and his ships thereby are kept
pretty constantly employed, instead of lying in harbours,
and their officers having no other employment than entertaining
the ladies on shore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">9 July.</div>

<div class="sidenote">23 July.</div>

<p>But to return. After the engagement above mentioned,
the <em>Doutelle</em> proceeded on her voyage soon after the council
of war was ended. But before she set sail for Scotland, all
her lights were put out, except that for the compass, which
still was so close confined that not the least ray could emit.
This caution was observed every night through the whole
voyage till their landing in Erisca. On July 11th she was
chased, and made a clear ship to engage; but trusting more
to their speed than to their military power, they made all the
sail they could and escaped all pursuers. The 15th and 16th
they had a rough sea and tempestuous weather. Then they
[<em>fol.</em> 505.]
had fine weather till about midnight on the 20th, which was
very stormy. The 21st being very mild, they sounded and
found ground at 108 fathom. On the 22d they made a
small island called Bernera, being the southernmost of the
western isles of Scotland, near the latitude of 57. On the
23rd they arrived at the island of Erisca, belonging to Clanranald,
which lies betwixt the isles of Barra and South Uist
or Ouist, having been eighteen days at sea from July 5th.</p>

<p>They were scarce arrived when they spied two sail which
they apprehended to be ships of war, and therefore got all
their money, arms, and ammunition on shore as fast as they
could. All went ashore except the Marquis of Tullibardine,
who was laid up in the gout and could not stir. Their
fears, however, were soon dissipated by finding the ships
proved only merchantmen.</p>

<p>The very first night they landed happened to prove
[<em>fol.</em> 506.]
violently stormy and wet, and they were obliged to lodge in
one of the little country houses wherein there were already
many others that were weatherbound.</p>

<p>Here they were all refreshed as well as the place could
afford, and they had some beds, but not sufficient for the
whole company, on which account the Prince, being less
fatigued than the others, insisted upon such to go to bed
as most wanted it. Particularly he took care of Sir Thomas
Sheridan, and went to examine his bed and to see that the
sheets were well aired. The landlord, observing him to search
the bed so narrowly, and at the same time hearing him
declare he would sit up all night, called out to him and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
that it was so good a bed, and the sheets were so good,
that a prince need not be ashamed to lie in them.</p>

<p>The Prince, not being accustomed to such fires in the
middle of the room, and there being no other chimney than a
[<em>fol.</em> 507.]
hole in the roof, was almost choaked, and was obliged to
go often to the door for fresh air. This at last made the
landlord, Angus MacDonald, call out, 'What a plague is the
matter with that fellow, that he can neither sit nor stand still,
and neither keep within nor without doors?'</p>

<p>From Eriska some of the company sent to Roger MacNeil,
Esquire of Barra, as relations, being come thither, and who
would be glad to see him: but he happened to be from home.
At the same time they sent out several other messengers upon
the same errand to several gentlemen in different parts, particularly
to Alexander MacDonald of Boisdale, esquire, who went
to them the next day.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But when he found upon what errand
they were come to Scotland, he did all he could to prevail
upon them to return to France without making any attempt to
[<em>fol.</em> 508.]
proceed. His advice being in vain, he then went to several
persons to caution them from being drawn into either any rising
or promises so to do. By this means he prevented some hundreds
of people from joining them, for which he had a letter of
thanks from Lord London and others for the great services he
had done the present government.</p>

<p>From this place Mr. Æneas MacDonald, the banker, took
boat and went to his brother of Kinlochmoidart, being at the
distance of about forty miles. Kinlochmoidart accompanied
the banker back to Eriska. Amongst those who went on board
the <em>Doutelle</em> at Eriska, and there laid the plan of the operations
and contrived the scheme, were the foresaid Donald MacDonald
of Kinlochmoidart, esquire, and Ronald MacDonald
of Clanronald, junior, esquire, who commanded that clan.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">24 July</div>

<p>Kinlochmoidart was made a colonel and aid-de-camp to the
Prince, and was to have been made a baronet and peer of
[<em>fol.</em> 509.]
Scotland. He was an exceeding cool-headed man, fit for either
cabinet or field. He was frequently employed in going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
from one friend of the cause to another. Upon one of these
expeditions he was either going or had been when both he
and his servant were taken by some country people, and sent
to the Castle of Edinburgh, whence he was removed to Carlisle,
and was there put to death upon Saturday, October 18th, the
festival of St. Luke the Evangelist, 1746. The place where he
was made prisoner is called Lesmahagoe, and he was committed
to Edinburgh Castle on the 12th of November 1745.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26 July</div>

<p>Having dismissed several messengers to their respective friends
on the continent of Scotland, they set sail about the 26th of
July 1745, and coasting about the isles between Sky and Mull,
and landing some of their passengers, proceeded to Lochshiel in
[<em>fol.</em> 510.]
Lochabar.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Of this the government was informed, as we find
by a paragraph in the Gazette of Saturday, August 17th,
1745, from Edinburgh, dated on the 11th of the same month.</p>

<p>Here it will not be amiss to give a short account of the vile
and dishonourable method used for seizing the Duke of Perth,
who was actually in the hands of the Highland officers, Sir
Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre and Mr. Campbell of Inveraa,
at his own house of Drummond Castle, but he had the good
fortune to make his escape from them. The manner of both
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A warrant being out to take the Duke of Perth, it was given
to the above officers to put it in execution. They, not daring
to attempt it openly without a large force, the sight of which
would give a sufficient alarm for him to escape, they therefore
thought of the following scandalous method. As they were
often hospitably entertained at his table, they sent him word
[<em>fol.</em> 511.]
that they were to dine with him at such a time. He sent
them word back that he should be proud to see them. The
time appointed being come (July 26th, 1745), they went as
usual, and according to the Duke's generous temper were entertained
at dinner. One of his footmen having spied some men
in arms coming towards the house, called the Duke to the door
of the room and told him what he had seen, begging his Grace
in the meantime to take care of himself. This the servant did
more than once; but the Duke always smiled and would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
suspect any gentlemen to be guilty of any such dirty action.
After dinner, the officers having drunk a little while, and the
time being come when they had appointed the soldiers to
surround the house at a little distance, were pleased to inform
his Grace of their errand, pulling out their orders for that
[<em>fol.</em> 512.]
purpose. The Duke commanded his temper very well, and
seeming not to be much displeased, told them he would step
into the closet, which was in the room where they were sitting,
and get himself ready. To this they agreed, as they thought
he could not go out of the room. He went into the closet and
(gently locking the door) slipt down a pair of backstairs, which
came to the closet, and got into the wood joining his gardens
with much difficulty. In making his way through the wood
(which was surrounded), he got all his legs much scratched
and wounded with the briars and thorns; and he behoved
sometimes to crawl on his hands and feet to keep himself from
being seen by the sentinels at their different posts. The officers
waited some time, and the Duke not returning, they went to
the closet door, which, being locked, they called some of the
servants, who told them their master was gone away on horseback
in a great hurry. After the Duke got out of the wood
[<em>fol.</em> 513.]
he lay squat for some time in a dry ditch till the party should
be gone. The officers and their command, on their return to
Crieff, the place where they quartered, passed so near the ditch
that the Duke heard all that they spoke. When the party
were all out of sight the Duke rose up to look about him, and
spying a countryman with a little horse, he desired to have the
use of the horse, which the countryman readily complied with.
The horse had neither saddle nor bridle, but only a branks (or
halter) about its head. However, in this pickle did the Duke
ride to the house of Mr. Murray of Abercairny. From that he
went to the house of Mr. Drummond of Logie. At night,
when all were in bed, Logie Drummond, entertaining fears he
could not really account for, got out of bed, and going to the
Duke's bed chamber, awaked him and begged him to be gone
speedily to some other place; for that he was afraid of his not
[<em>fol.</em> 514.]
being safe to stay all night. Logie would not leave him till he
saw him out of the house, and the Duke was not well gone
when a party came (in dead of night), and searched the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
very narrowly for the Duke. It is worth remarking here that
when Sir Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre was made a prisoner on
Gladesmuirfield, the Duke of Perth came up to him, and asking
how he did, spoke these words to him very pleasantly, 'Sir
Petie, I am to dine with you to-day.'</p>

<p>But to return. At Lochshiel in Lochabar they unloaded
their ship, the chief of whose cargo consisted of brandy (a liquor
absolutely necessary in the Highlands), a thousand stand of
arms, a proportionable quantity of ammunition, and some
provisions.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">3 Aug.</div>

<p>About the 3d or 4th of August they had cleared the ship.
The next day it was known that the Prince was arrived, and
young Clanranald sent a guard to attend him.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 515.]
During this time all the messengers were very successful, and
several of the Prince's friends began to be in motion, and
gathered their respective vassals in order to be ready to attend
at the setting up of the standard.</p>

<p>While these were busy raising men, etc., others were as
much employed in procuring a sufficient quantity of oatmeal,
which, being scarce, cost seventeen shillings sterling per boll.
In about the space of three weeks, having laid up a large
quantity of oatmeal, and having a sufficient quantity of
brandy (two of the most grateful things that could be given to
a Highlander), the Prince thought it high time to begin to try
his fortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">19 Aug.</div>

<p>About the 11th of August the Prince sailed to Kinlochmoidart,
about 25 miles farther, where he stayed till the 17th.
As he went from hence he was joined by about 150 men. On
the 18th he crossed Lochshiel and lay at Glensiarich,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and from
thence on the 19th they proceeded to Glenfinnan at the head
of the loch in Clanranald's country, and there set up his
[<em>fol.</em> 516.]
standard, on which there was no motto at all, and was
immediately joined by Lochiel, Keppoch, and others, with 1400
men in all. Young Clanranald had joined him before.</p>

<p>Here a considerable number of both gentlemen and ladies
met to see the ceremony; among the rest was the famous Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Jeanie Cameron<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> (as she is commonly though very improperly
called, for she is a widow nearer 50 than 40 years of age). She
is a genteel, well-look'd, handsome woman, with a pair of pretty
eyes, and hair as black as jet. She is of a very sprightly genius,
and is very agreeable in conversation. She was so far from
accompanying the Prince's army that she went off with the
rest of the spectators as soon as the army marched. Neither
did she ever follow the camp, nor was ever with the Prince, but
in public when he had his Court at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Here it must be remarked that Mr. Anthony Welch, the
owner of the <em>Doutelle</em>, an eminent merchant of Nantz, after
[<em>fol.</em> 517.]
having landed his passengers and cargo as above mentioned,
(towards which expence the Prince gave him £2000 sterling,
and knighted him, making him a present of a gold-hilted
sword, which cost eighty louis d'ores, and was bought for the
Prince against the intended Dunkirk expedition in 1743), this
merchant, I say, after landing his passengers, went a privateering,
having a letter of mark, and was of signal service to the
Highland army by taking six or seven prizes, the chief of which
were loaded with meal. The biggest of these he ransomed for
£60 sterling, and also the others in proportion, on condition
the owners would carry their lading and sell it to the Prince,
etc., but if they did not bring certificates of that then the
ransom was to be three times as much. This Mr. Welch chiefly
trades to Martinico. He has 24 merchantmen and privateers,
one of which took &mdash;&mdash; man-of-war in &mdash;&mdash;
[<em>fol.</em> 518.]
and sold it to the King of France for 15,000 livres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 Aug.</div>

<p>Upon the 20th of August the Prince proceeded on his march
towards Castle Blair in Athol. On the 23d he was joined by
about 500, on the 26th by 50, on the 28th by 100, on the
29th by 150 at Garviemore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were at Corierag, hoping to fight Cope, they had
been also joined by Ardshiel, commanding the Stewarts of
Appin, Glenco, Glengary, and some others. The author of
<span class="smcap">Ascanius</span><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> makes the Prince avoid fighting Cope, but it was
quite otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30 Aug.</div>

<p>August 30th they arrived at Dalnacardoch in the mountain
of Dirmochter, and on the 31st at Blair Castle, which Duke
James quitted a few days before upon receiving a letter from
his brother, Duke William, alias Marquis of Tullibardine. On
the last of August Old MacGregor, alias Graham of Glengyle,
had seized, by surprize, forty men of General Campbell's regiment
who were mending the Duke of Argyle's roads.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 519.]
In this route Lochgary, Dr. Cameron, and O'Sullivan were
sent to Ruthven in Badenoch to take the Barracks. Neither
side had any canon. The Highland party endeavoured to set
fire to the door, but the soldiers fired through holes in the
door, killed one man and mortally wounded two more; and
then the party retired. All this time O'Sullivan hid himself
in a barn. This garrison consisted of 12 men, commanded by
Serjeant Molloy. About this time a new raised company
belonging to Lord Loudon deserted and joined the Prince's
army.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1747.
19 Nov<sup>r</sup>.</div>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Upon Thursday, November 19th, 1747, I visited Dr.
John Burton [physician] of York, at his lodgings in Edinburgh,
where I had the favour of the original draught in the doctor's
own hand-writ, from which I made out the above transcript.
The Doctor had come into Scotland purposely to make enquiry
about matters relating to the Prince's affairs. The above is
[<em>fol.</em> 520.]
much more to be depended upon than that taken from Duncan
Cameron, because Mr. Æneas MacDonald<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> is a gentleman who
got a liberal education, and was one of the Prince's council,
and therefore had an opportunity of knowing things distinctly;
whereas Duncan Cameron, being only a servant, could know
things but imperfectly and at second-hand. Meantime it is
worth observing that the journal taken from Duncan Cameron
and others is the fullest and exactest of the two as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
marching of the Prince's army down the country to Edinburgh,
which Dr. Burton acknowledged.</p>

<p>Upon the foresaid day I also received from Dr. Burton in
his own hand-writ the two following short narratives.</p>

<p>I. The Laird of MacKinnon, after ferrying the Prince over
from the Isle of Sky to the continent, took leave of him, and
then set out upon his return home. The Prince left Knoidart
and went to Glenbiasdale, being about ten miles, where he
stayed two or three nights, till he heard of the arrival of
[<em>fol.</em> 521.]
Captain Scott with 500 men, and General Campbell with 400
more, who having received notice whereabouts the Prince was,
were endeavouring to surround him; they and their men being
then within three miles of him on all sides. But notwithstanding
all the efforts of his enemies, who had all the reason imaginable
to expect to get their prey, yet he, by God's providence,
slipt them all once more in the night, and travelled 25 Scotch
miles in a few hours over rough mountains into Lochaber.
The better to deceive his pursuers, he got two or three different
men to personate him and to take different routes, by which
stratagem, in all probability, he extricated himself out of the
then dangers, and once more preserved his life and liberty.</p>

<p>The above taken by Dr. Burton from the mouth of Donald
MacDonald of Garryfleugh, prisoner in London in the same
messenger's house with Clanronald, Boisdale, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 Sept.</div>

<p>II. The vessel which carried the Prince over from Scotland
[<em>fol.</em> 522.]
was the <em>Bellona</em> of St. Malo's, a Nantz privateer of 32 carriage
and 12 swivel guns and 340 men. She was afterwards taken
on the 2d of February 1746-7 by three men-of-war only, the
<em>Eagle</em>, the <em>Edinburgh</em>, and the <em>Nottingham</em>. The Prince, after
seeing such of his friends as were present first on board, embarked
and set sail immediately for France (September 20th, 1746),<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
where he landed safely at Roscort, near three leagues west of
Morlaise, on the 29th of the same month, having had a very
good voyage. The ship was commanded by one Colonel
Warren, and had another privateer along with her.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">23 Nov.</div>

<p>Upon Monday, November 23d, 1747, Dr. Burton favoured me
with a visit, when he was pleased to tell me that some time in
the month of September 1746, he took the freedom to ask at
[<em>fol.</em> 523.]
Mr. Æneas MacDonald his opinion of Mr. John Murray of
Broughton, particularly whether or not he entertained any
fears about his turning evidence, as the common talk in London
gave it out? Mr. MacDonald's answer was that he believed
Mr. Murray of Broughton to be so honest between man and
man, that in private life he would not be guilty of a dirty or
dishonest action; but then, he said, he knew him to be such a
coward, and to be possessed with such a fear for death, that (for
his own part) he was much afraid Mr. Murray might be brought
the length of doing any thing to save a wretched life!</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746.
June.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 524.] Miss MacDonald had gone from Sky to Milton in South
Uist<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> in order to visit her brother-german, who had about that
time taken up house. She had not been long there till Captain
O'Neil (by some lucky accident or other) had become acquainted
with her.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> When the Prince was surrounded with difficulties
on all hands, and knew not well what to do for his future safety,
Captain O'Neil brought Miss MacDonald to the place where
the Prince was, and there they concerted the plan. At that
time Miss returned to Milton. After Miss MacDonald had
(with some difficulty)<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> agreed to undertake the dangerous
enterprize, she set out for Clanranald's house, Saturday, June
21st, and at one of the fords was taken prisoner by a party of
militia, she not having a passport. She demanded to whom
they belonged? And finding by the answer that her step-father
was then commander, she refused to give any answers
till she should see their captain. So she and her servant, Neil
MacKeehan, were prisoners all that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">22 June.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 525.]
Her stepfather, coming next day, being Sunday, she told
him what she was about, upon which he granted a passport for
herself, a man-servant (Neil MacKechan), and another woman
Bettie Burk, a good spinster, and whom he recommended as
such in a letter to his wife at Armadale in Sky, as she had
much lint to spin.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> If her stepfather (Hugh MacDonald of
Armadale) had not granted Miss a passport, she could not have
undertook her journey and voyage. Armadale set his stepdaughter
at liberty, who immediately made the best of her
way to Clanranald's house and acquainted the Lady Clanranald
with the scheme, who supplied the Prince with apparel sufficient
for his disguise, viz. a flower'd linen gown, a white apron, etc.,
and sent some provisions along with him.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>During Miss MacDonald's stay at Clanranald's house, which
was till the Friday, June 27th, O'Neil went several times betwixt
[<em>fol.</em> 526.]
the Prince and Miss, in which interval another scheme was
proposed, that the Prince should go under the care of a gentleman
to the northward,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> but that failing them, they behoved to
have recourse to that agreed upon before; and accordingly
Lady Clanranald, one Mrs. MacDonald, O'Neil, Miss Flora
MacDonald, and her servant, Neil MacKechan, went to the
place where the Prince was, being about eight Scotch miles.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
He was then in a very little house or hut, assisting in the
roasting of his dinner, which consisted of the heart, liver,
kidneys, etc., of a bullock or sheep, upon a wooden spit.
O'Neil introduced his young preserver and the company, and
she sat on the Prince's right hand and Lady Clanranald on his
left. Here they all dined very heartily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28 June.</div>

<p>Next morning, June 28th, they heard of General Campbell's
arrival at Benbecula, and soon after a man came in a great
hurry to Lady Clanranald and acquainted her that Captain
Ferguson with an advanced party of Campbell's men was at her
[<em>fol.</em> 527.]
house, and that Ferguson had lain in her bed the night before.
This obliged her to go home immediately, which accordingly
she did, after taking leave of the Prince. She was strictly
examined by Ferguson where she had been? She replied she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
had been visiting a child which had been sick, but was now
better again.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Both the General and Ferguson asked many
other questions, such as where the child lived, how far it was
from thence? etc., but they could make nothing out of the
lady fit for their purpose.</p>

<p>O'Neil would gladly have staid with the Prince and shared
in his distresses and dangers, but Miss could by no means be
prevailed upon to agree to that proposal.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>When all were gone who were not to accompany the Prince
in his voyage to the Isle of Sky, Miss MacDonald desired him
to dress himself in his new attire, which was soon done, and at
a proper time they removed their quarters and went near the
water with their boat afloat, nigh at hand for readiness to embark
[<em>fol.</em> 528.]
in case of an alarm from the shore. Here they arrived,
very wet and wearied, and made a fire upon a rock to keep
them somewhat warm till night.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> They were soon greatly
alarmed by seeing four wherries full of armed men making
towards shore, which made them extinguish their fire quickly,
and to conceal themselves amongst the heath.</p>

<p>About two or three days after O'Neil parted from the Prince,
a French cutter, having 120 men on board, appeared and sailed
towards the Isle of South Uist, intending to carry off the
Prince.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> O'Sullivan went immediately on board, while O'Neil
made haste to find out the Prince before he might have left
the island. But finding that the Prince had left the island
about two days before, immediately he returned to the place
where he had left the cutter. But unhappy for him, he found
that the timorous Sullivan, having a fair wind, and not having
[<em>fol.</em> 529.]
courage to stay till O'Neil's return, being resolved to take care
of Number One, obliged the captain to set sail directly, lest he
should be taken and should lose his precious life. O'Neil returned
in the compass of three hours after Sullivan had set sail,
and was taken prisoner soon after and brought into England,
after having been prisoner for some time in the Castle of Edinburgh<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>,
to which place he had been brought from a ship of
war; for he had been in a state of confinement at sea for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
time. An English officer, having intelligence of the above
cutter, immediately dispatched two wherries after her with
thirty men in each, but neither of them could come up with
her.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, June 28th, Saturday, 1746, the Prince, Miss
Flora MacDonald, Neil MacKechan, etc., set sail in a very
clear evening from Benbecula to the Isle of Sky.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> It is worth
[<em>fol.</em> 530.]
observing here that Benbecula is commonly reckoned a part of
South Uist, they being divided from one another by the sea
only at high water, which then makes a short ferry betwixt the
two; but at low water people walk over upon the sand from
the one to the other.</p>

<p>They had not rowed from the shore above a league till the
sea became rough, and at last tempestuous, and to entertain the
company the Prince sung several songs and seemed to be in
good spirits.</p>

<p>In the passage Miss MacDonald fell asleep, and then the
Prince carefully guarded her, lest in the darkness any of the
men should chance to step upon her. She awaked in a surprize
with some little bustle in the boat, and wondered what was the
matter, etc.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">29 June</div>

<p>Next morning, Sunday, June 29th, the boatmen knew not
where they were, having no compass and the wind varying
several times, it being then again calm.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> However, at last
they made to the point of Waternish, in the west corner of
Sky, where they thought to have landed, but found the place
[<em>fol.</em> 531.]
possessed by a body of forces who had three boats or yawls
near the shore. One on board one of the boats fired at them
to make them bring-to; but they rowed away as fast as they
could, being all the chance they had to escape, because there
were several ships of war within sight. They got into a creek,
or rather clift of a rock, and there remained some short time to
rest the men, who had been all night at work, and to get their
dinners of what provisions they had along with them. As soon as
they could they set forwards again, because as the militia could
not bring them to, they had sent up to alarm a little town not
far off. It was very lucky for them that it was a calm then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
for otherwise they must inevitably have perished or have been
taken.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>From hence they rowed on and landed at Kilbride, in
Troternish, in the Isle of Sky, about twelve miles north from
the above-mentioned point. There were also several parties of
[<em>fol.</em> 532.]
militia in the neighbourhood of Kilbride. Miss left the Prince
in the boat and went with her servant, Neil MacKechan, to
Mougstot, Sir Alexander MacDonald's house, and desired one
of the servants to let Lady Margaret MacDonald know she was
come to see her ladyship in her way to her mother's house.
Lady Margaret knew her errand well enough by one Mrs MacDonald,
who had gone a little before to apprize her of it.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>As Mr. Alexander MacDonald of Kingsburgh was accidentally
there, Lady Margaret desired him to conduct the Prince
to his house; for it is to be remarked that Lady Margaret did
not see the Prince in any shape. Kingsburgh sent a boy down
to the boat with instructions whither to conduct the Prince
[<em>fol.</em> 533.]
about a mile, and he (Kingsburgh) would be there ready to
conduct him.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Then Kingsburgh took some wine, etc., to refresh
the Prince with, and set forwards for the place of rendezvous,
leaving Miss MacDonald with Lady Margaret at Mougstot,
where the commanding officer of the parties in search of
the Prince was, and who asked Miss whence she came, whither
she was going, what news? etc., all which Miss answered as she
thought most proper, and so as to prevent any discovery of
what she had been engaged in.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Lady Margaret pressed Miss very much in presence of the
officer to stay, telling her that she had promised to make some
stay the first time she should happen to come there. But Miss
desired to be excused at that time, because she wanted to see
her mother, and to be at home in these troublesome times.
Lady Margaret at last let her go, and she and Mrs MacDonald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 534.]
above mentioned set forwards with Neil MacKechan and said
Mrs MacDonald's maid and her man-servant. They overtook
the Prince and Kingsburgh. Mrs. MacDonald was very
desirous to see the Prince's countenance; but as he went along
he always turned away his face from Mrs MacDonald to the
opposite side whenever he perceived her endeavouring to stare
him in the countenance. But yet she got several opportunities
of seeing his face, though in disguise, which the maid could not
help taking notice of, and said she had never seen such an
impudent-looked woman, and durst say she was either an Irish
woman or else a man in a woman's dress. Miss MacDonald
replied she was an Irish woman, for she had seen her before.
The maid also took notice of the Prince's awkward way
of managing the petticoats, and what long strides he took in
walking along, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> which obliged Miss MacDonald to desire
Mrs. MacDonald (they being both on horseback), to step a
[<em>fol.</em> 535.]
little faster and leave those on foot, because, as there were
many parties of militia in the great roads, it was necessary for
the Prince to cross the country, and it was not proper to let
Mrs. MacDonald's man or maid servant see it. So on they
went, and the Prince and Kingsburgh went over the hills and
travelled south-south-east till they arrived at Kingsburgh's
house, which was about twelve o'clock at night, and they were
very wet. But Miss MacDonald, who had parted with her
companions and her man-servant on the road, arrived some
short time before the Prince.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">30 June.</div>

<p>Here the Prince got his most material refreshment, and was
very much fatigued.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Yet he was very merry till the company
parted to go to rest. Morning being come and pretty far advanced,
Miss MacDonald was in pain about the Prince's lying
so long in bed lest he should be overtaken by his enemies, and
therefore she entreated Kingsburgh to go and call him up,
[<em>fol.</em> 536.]
which with much ado he was prevailed upon to comply with,
he being desirous that the Prince should take as long rest as he
could, not knowing when he could meet with the like again.
Accordingly Kingsburgh went into the Prince's bed-chamber
and found him in so profound a sleep that he could not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of awakening him, and so retired softly out of the room.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> But
at last the day began to be far advanced, and Miss MacDonald
was very uneasy, everything being prepared for the journey
agreed upon. Though the Prince was determined (from the
observations and persuasion of Kingsburgh)<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> to cast off his
disguise, yet it was necessary he should leave the house in the
female dress he came in, which would, if enquiry happened to
be made, prevent the servants telling the particular dress he had
put on when he stript himself of the gown, petticoats, etc., and
therefore in Kingsburgh's house Miss put on his cap for him.</p>

<p>The day was far advanced before he set out, and when he
[<em>fol.</em> 537.]
arrived at a wood side (as the affair had been concerted), not far
from Kingsburgh, he changed his apparel once more and put
on the Highland dress Kingsburgh had furnished him with.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
Then Kingsburgh sent a guide with him to Portree, thro' all
byways, while Miss MacDonald went thither on horseback by
another road, thereby the better to gain intelligence and at the
same time to prevent a discovery. They were very wet, it
having rained very much. Here he only dried his clothes,
took some little refreshment, and staid about two hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 July</div>

<p>Hither Kingsburgh had sent to prepare a boat, and to have
it ready to convey the Prince to the place where he wanted to
be at, not allowing the people about Portree in the meantime
to know anything about the person's being the Prince whom
they were to receive and to take care of. Young MacLeod of
[<em>fol.</em> 538.]
Raaza came with Malcolm MacLeod to conduct the Prince
over to the Island of Raaza. The Prince was very uneasy he
had not a MacDonald to conduct him still. He left Portree on
Tuesday, the 1st of July, and landed that very same day at a
place called Glam in Raaza.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<p>Miss MacDonald took leave of the Prince at Portree, and
from thence went to her mother, after a fatiguing journey
cross the country. She never told her mother, or indeed
anybody else, what she had done.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> About eight or ten days
after, she received a message from one of her own name, Donald
MacDonald of Castleton in Sky, who lived about four miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
from Slate or Armadale, to come to his house, an officer
of an Independent Company (one MacLeod of Taliskar)
having desired him so to do. She, a little suspicious of
what might happen, thought proper to consult some of her
friends<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> what she should do in the matter. They unanimously
agreed she ought not to go, at least till next day; but go she
[<em>fol.</em> 539.]
would. Then she was instructed what to say upon an examination;
and accordingly, when that happened, she said she had
seen a great lusty woman, who came to the boatside as she
was going on board and begged to have a passage, saying
she was a soldier's wife. Her request was granted, and when
she landed in Sky, she went away, thanking Miss for her
favour. Miss added withal that she knew nothing of what
became of her afterwards.</p>

<p>Miss set forwards, as she proposed, to her friend's house,
whither she had been desired to come, and on the road she
met her father (Armadale) returning home; and soon after she
was taken by an officer and a party of soldiers, who were
going to her mother's house in pursuit of her.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> They carried
her on board a ship, and would not suffer her to return
home to take leave of her friends. She was carried on board
[<em>fol.</em> 540.]
the <em>Furnace</em>, commanded by Captain John Ferguson, a sloop
of war, where General Campbell happened then to be, who
ordered Miss MacDonald to be used with the utmost respect.</p>

<p>About three weeks afterwards, Miss, in cruizing about,
being near her stepfather's house, the General permitted her
to go ashore and take leave of her friends, but under a
guard of two officers and a party of soldiers, with strict
orders that she was not to speak anything in Erse, or
anything at all but in the presence and in the hearing of the
officers. And therefore she stayed only about two hours,
and then returned again to the ship.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1747.
23 Nov.</div>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;The above I transcribed from Dr Burton's own
hand-writ. Happening to mention several questions that were
fit to be proposed to Miss MacDonald, the Doctor desired
me to give him them in writing, for that he would endeavour
to procure direct answers to them. Accordingly, I gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to him in writing, and he performed what he had promised.
[<em>fol.</em> 541.]
Here follows an exact copy of the questions and their answers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question 1st.</span>&mdash;Ask particularly at Miss MacDonald by what
lucky accident it came about that she and Captain O'Neil had
a meeting at first to concert measures? Whether or not it
was by direction of her stepfather, Armadale, or of any other
person? For as O'Neil was an entire stranger in the country
this is a material question, and must remain a mystery till
Miss clears it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;When the Prince and his few men were skulking
in the Long Isle, O'Neil used to scour about frequently by
himself to try what he could learn, and this led him to be
several times at Milton before he made the proposal to Miss
MacDonald, as they were then skulking thereabouts. O'Neil,
by being free and easy with Miss and her brother, came soon
to learn their history, and that their mother lived in Sky, etc.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Ask particularly if Armadale had any private meeting
(in person) with the Prince while skulking. For it is certain
that General Campbell complained that Armadale was the
person who had misled him when searching for the Young
Pretender in the Long Isle.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;When the Prince first landed upon the continent
of Scotland, Armadale, happening to be on the continent, was
walking upon the shore just as the Prince and his friends were
[<em>fol.</em> 542.]
sailing towards it. Armadale, spying a sail making towards
the very spot upon which he was walking, stopt till he should
learn what the ship was, and from whence she had come. When
the Prince stept ashore, Armadale was the first man that took
him by the hand and kissed it, for he was introduced to the
Prince by those that were along with him. The Prince and
Armadale conversed some time together. Soon after this Armadale
returned to the Isle of Sky, and never saw the Prince
again, either before or in the time of his skulking.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>3.&mdash;It is said that Armadale writ a letter, which he sent by
Miss MacDonald to her mother, recommending the Irish
girl, Bettie Burk, as a good servant, and giving an account of
her good qualifications as such. It were to be wished that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Miss could recollect the contents of said letter as exactly as
possible, in order to give a narrative of the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;The substance of the writing which Armadale sent
to his wife, was as is already mentioned in Miss MacDonald's
own journal.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>4.&mdash;Ask what particular songs he chaunted in crossing from
the Long Isle to Sky? if she can give the names of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;He sung 'The King shall enjoy his own again,'
[<em>fol.</em> 543.]
and 'The twenty-ninth of May,' etc.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Ask whether or not Lady Clanronald furnished the
Prince and Miss MacDonald with some bottles full of milk as
part of their provisions on board the boat in the passage to
Sky? And whether or not the Prince did put the bottle to
his head, and drink in common with those on board?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;Lady Clanronald did furnish them with some
bottles of milk, and the Prince (in the passage) putting the
bottle to his head, drank in common with those on board
<em>Jock-fellow-like</em>. Lady Clanronald had but one half-bottle of
wine (there being so many demands upon her, particularly from
parties of the military) which she likewise caused to be put on
board the boat. The Prince in the passage would not allow
any person to share in this small allowance of wine, but kept
it altogether for Miss MacDonald's use, lest she should faint
with the cold and other inconveniences of a night passage.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;To the proceeding questions Dr. Burton was pleased to
[<em>fol.</em> 544.]
add one of his own, which is what length of time there
happened to be betwixt the Prince's leaving Kingsburgh's
house and Captain Ferguson's coming thither to search for him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span>&mdash;About six or seven days; so that the Prince
behoved by that time to be actually upon the continent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Miss Flora MacDonald was upon the 28th of November
1746 put on board the <em>Royal Sovereign</em> lying at the Nore,
and upon the 6th of December following, was removed to
London and put into the custody of Mr. Dick, a messenger, in
whose hands were likewise Dr. Burton, Æneas MacDonald,
Malcolm MacLeod, Clanronald, senior, Boisdale, etc. But Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Clanronald was not allowed to be in the same messenger's
house with her husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746.
July.</div>

<p>The Prince in going into the hut where the thieves<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> were
(being forced to do it), having been eight and forty hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
without any sustenance, was discovered by one of them who knew
him well.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> This trusty fellow, knowing the Prince's condition,
[<em>fol.</em> 548.]
and at the same time, not daring to tell his companions who
their new guest was, had the presence of mind to call out, 'Ha,
Dougal MacCullony, I am glad to see thee.' By this the
Prince found that he was known to this man, and that the man
behoved to be a friend by the expression he had now used.
The Prince took the hint and humoured the joke so well that
he owned the name given him, and accordingly sat down and
ate very heartily of some boyled beef and pottage. The man
who knew the Prince found (after talking privately with the
Prince) that it was necessary to inform his companions who
their new guest was. Upon knowing of this they rejoiced
greatly and made it their study how to serve him in the best
manner they could, two of them being always employed by
turns to keep sentry or a good look-out, and to bring in
provisions, which they did in plenty. In short they behaved
with the utmost fidelity and respect to him while amongst
them.</p>

<p>When the Prince and, I think, Cameron of Glenbean or Glenpain
[<em>fol.</em> 549.]
were travelling together, one day the latter after going
about three miles,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> missed his purse,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> wherein he had forty
guineas and would needs go back for it. But the Prince was
not at all for his returning upon any account. However,
Glenbean was positive not to want the purse, and therefore he
desired the Prince to wait behind a hill near the place where
they then were till he should come to him again. The Prince
was obliged to comply, and Glenpean had not gone far before
a party of soldiers appeared and marched the very road they
should have gone had not Glenbean left his purse; by which
means the Prince must inevitably have been taken. The
Prince lay snug and watched the road the soldiers went, waiting
Glenpane's return. Glenbean found his purse and returned
with joy, the Prince at that time having no money, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the chief reason that made Glenpean so positive on returning
[<em>fol.</em> 550.]
to seek for the purse. The Prince told him what he had
seen, on which they took a different route, heartily thanking
Providence for so lucky and so seasonable an accident.</p>

<p>The Prince, not many days after his return from Sky to the
continent, sent one to Glenbean<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> (I think) desiring Glenbean
to meet him at such a place. But before the messenger and
Glenbean came to him he was obliged to remove from the
place appointed upon seeing some soldiers approaching towards
it. Glenpane and the guide coming to the place and not finding
the Prince, parted and went different roads in order (if
possible) to find him out. After the Prince had left the place
appointed for the meeting, it became so very misty or foggy
that a person could not see a yard before him. During the
continuance of this fog Glenbean walking up a vale accidentally
met with the Prince, being so near as to rub upon one
another before the one could discern the other. The Prince
in a bold manner asked the other who he was, the Prince
being ready for a defence provided it had been an enemy.
[<em>fol.</em> 551.]
The answer being given, the Prince said, You are the man I sent
for, and I am such an one. Soon after this, another guide
being got (for they never heard any more of the former guide,
who parted from Glenbean when both of them were endeavouring
to find out the Prince), they set out for the place whither
the Prince was a-going; and the fog still remaining as thick as
before, the Prince happened to fall, and was going headlong
down a precipice of above twenty fathoms deep, when the guide
most happily catched hold of his foot. But the Prince's
weight brought him down also, and both of them must inevitably
have had their brains knock'd out had it not been for
Glenbean's seizing fast hold of the guide who still kept fast
hold of the Prince though in so much danger himself. By the
help of Glenbean and some shrubs growing on the side of the
precipice they recovered themselves and were both preserved.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 552.]
As soon as the besiegers of Fortwilliam left the place, a
party of Caroline Scott's men from within the fort went to the
house of Cameron of Gleneavis and plundered it, and stript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
his lady of all her cloaths, one petticoat only excepted, taking
the very shirt off her and looking upon it as a favour to allow
her to untie her own petticoats. They stript one of Dr.
Cameron's daughters, a girl that was staying with her aunt at
Gleneavis. They stript Gleneavis's only son, a boy about
seven years of age, who having gold loops and gold buttons
on his cloaths, the soldiers were so greedy of them though half
worn that one of them took out his knife and cut them all off.
In his hurry cutting off the button upon the child's shoulder,
he cut with so great force that he wounded the side of the
boy's neck. The mother seeing the blood immediately swooned
away, imagining the villain had cut the boy's throat. But
[<em>fol.</em> 553.]
when she came to herself she examined the wound and found it
of no great consequence.</p>

<p>This lady with her own and two of her brother's children
was forced to go and live in a cave of a rock, where she stayed
six months, making the best shift she could for provisions to
herself and the poor helpless children. Captain Scott sent her
a message, pretending that what was done was without his
knowledge or consent, and that if she would go to Fort William
she should have such things as belonged to her. She consulted
her brother Lochiel, who advised her to go. She went
accordingly. The captain gave her her shoe-buckles, her
buttons for her shirt-sleeves, which in the hurry of taking the
soldiers had broke, and a cloak that had been taken from Dr.
Cameron's little daughter.</p>

<p>[<em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Gleneavis was never out, and only during the siege
of Fort William, some of the besiegers took up their quarters
at his house].</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 554.]
Notwithstanding, Scott pretended he knew nothing of the
soldiers' actions, yet he never punished any one of them for
what had been done. He wrote to the Duke of Cumberland
an account of what he or his men had done, who sent for
answer that he greatly approved of what had been done. This
letter from the Duke of Cumberland (amongst many others)
was taken when the post-boy was seized by some of the Highlanders,
and I believe it may be got.</p>

<p>The soldiers, or rather some of the independent companies,
being out upon the plundering affair, met with a poor old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
woman, who instead of a cap had a piece of linen cloath about
her head. One of the soldiers rather than have no prey at all,
took off the piece of cloath; and one of the officers (a Campbell)
seeing a head of gray hairs likely to make a good wig,
had it instantly cut off. Upon this the poor woman begged
to have her piece of linen cloth again to prevent her catching
[<em>fol.</em> 555.]
cold, but in lieu of that the officer gave her a kick in the
breech and bad her begone for an old bitch. She went to
General Campbell to make her complaint; but he said as the
officer was not under his command he could not relieve her,
but that had it been any of his officers or men he would have
made them restore what was taken. In the present situation
he said he could not assist her. This the old woman told to
Dr. Cameron's lady verbatim.</p>

<p>After plundering every place and destroying all the meal,
etc., and driving away all the cattle, etc., they destroyed all
ferry boats or removed them, and would neither suffer the
people to go out for provisions nor suffer any provisions to be
brought to them.</p>

<p>The Prince kept a regular journal.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland gave orders in writing sealed up
[<em>fol.</em> 556.]
and not to be opened till they should happen to catch the
Pretender, and if they should miss him, to return the orders
unopened.</p>

<p>A captain asked Kingsburgh at Fort Augustus about knowing
the young Pretender's head.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> The person so killed cried out
as he fell, 'You have murdered your Prince,' which so far
deceived them that the Duke of Cumberland went up directly
for London in full persuasion the thing was done.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen who came over with letters in cyphers
to the French ambassador sent to find out Lochiel.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> A third
was taken and hanged immediately by the military, they pretending
that he had once been a spy in Flanders, but he was
really an officer in the French army. There were about forty
volunteers on board the same ship with the said gentlemen.
They knew nothing of the battle of Culloden till their arrival
in Scotland. The Prince in disguise took a letter to them (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 557.]
from the Prince) desiring they would deliver up their letters to
the bearer, whom they might trust, for the Prince was afraid
they might be spies, and as he could talk French well he chose
rather to go himself under a borrowed name than to send any
person to them. When he came to them they delivered to
him all the letters, which, being in cyphers, he could not make
anything of. They were left by their own vessel, and so Lochiel
took care of them till the vessel came for the Prince. When
again they saw the Prince and knew him to be such they were
greatly ashamed that they had used him like a common man,
in which shape he had formerly appeared to them.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Warren went over to France on purpose to fetch a
vessel for carrying off the Prince and such as should be with
him.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 558.]
The Prince and Lochiel were obliged to remove their quarters
when Monroe of Culcairn<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> was killed, because they apprehended
there would be a much narrower scrutiny upon that account.</p>

<p>As the military had destroyed all the provisions in the
country, the poor old women used to follow where they had seen
the soldiers marched in order to get the bowels and the green
hides of the cattle which had been killed. These they used to
cut and to boil them upon a fire. The soldiers finding this
out used frequently to leave a party concealed, who, when the
poor women were regaling themselves about the fire, as above,
used to shoot them for diversion and for wagers, etc.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 559.]
Captain Ferguson, having one of Lochiel's brothers as a
prisoner, would not allow him a bed to lie on, nor anything
else but ropes and cables. He fell ill and was so bad that in
his then situation it was thought he could not recover. Complaint
was made to Lord Albemarle, who sent a physician to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
see him and make his report of him. He returned and said if
Mr. Cameron was not brought ashore or was better assisted he
must die soon by neglect and ill-usage. Accordingly, Lord
Albemarle sent a party for him with an order to Ferguson to
deliver up Mr. Cameron. But Ferguson said he was his prisoner
and he would not deliver him up to any person without an
express order from the Duke of Newcastle, or the Lords of the
[<em>fol.</em> 560.]
Admiralty. On this refusal Mr. Cameron's friends sent a bed
and bed cloaths with some other necessaries, with intent to put
them on board. But Ferguson swore if they offered to put
them on board he would sink them and their boat directly.
The captain soon afterwards sailed, and, when in the Thames,
poor Mr. Cameron died.</p>

in that which is to come. And I remain your Lordship's most
affectionate friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747
10 Dec.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 563.] <em>N.B.</em>&mdash;Upon Thursday, December 10th, 1747, from the hand
of my Lady Balmerino I received the original letter from
which I made the preceeding transcript wherein I have carefully
observed the spelling and pointing of the original, which was
an old coarse hand. The bit of paper inclosed in the letter
was the half of a square piece of paper which had been torn
from one of the corners to the opposite one. Upon asking
some questions about the letter, my Lady Balmerino was
pleased to give me the following history of it. Her ladyship
said that the letter was delivered to my Lord upon the
Friday (the date of the letter) before my lord's execution, and
that his lordship made a return to it wherein he acknowledged
the receipt of such a missive. A gentleman called for and
received the return at the bar of the British Coffee House, etc.
Soon after my Lord's death a gentleman called at my Lady
[<em>fol.</em> 564.]
Balmerino's lodgings desiring to know if her ladyship lodged
in that house, and having received information that she lodged
there, he said that was all he wanted to know and went off
directly. After my lady went to live in Mr. John Walkingshaw's
house the same gentleman (as is supposed) came and
enquired if Lady Balmerino lodged there. Mrs. Walkingshaw
happened to be the person that answered the call, took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
gentleman into a separate room and told him that my Lady
Balmerino lodged there, and that her ladyship being then in the
house he might see her if he pleased. To which the gentleman
answered that all he wanted to know was if my Lady Balmerino
lodged in that house; and was then making to go off when Mrs.
Walkingshaw informed him that Mr. Walkingshaw was at home
and begged him to stay a little and talk with him. But the
gentleman refused to see Mr. Walkingshaw. However, Mrs.
Walkingshaw pressed the gentleman so much that at last he
agreed to see Mr. Walkingshaw. In the course of the short
conversation (for the gentleman went soon off) the letter
[<em>fol.</em> 565.]
happened to be talk'd of, and the gentleman said he was not
the author of the letter, but that he was only employed about
that matter. Mr. Walkingshaw then told the gentleman how
much my Lady Balmerino would be indebted to such private
persons as would be pleased to take notice of her in her present
distressed condition; for that her ladyship was positively resolved
not to accept of the smallest assistance or favour from
the Court, if she should starve for want of bread. To this the
gentleman made no reply at all, but immediately took leave of
Mr. Walkingshaw. When Mr. Walkingshaw returned to the
room where he had left some company who had been dining
with him he told my Lady Balmerino and others present what
had passed betwixt the gentleman and himself, and withal
remarked that the gentleman looked very like one that used
to be much about Prince Frederick's Court. But he could not
[<em>fol.</em> 566.]
affirm any thing positively about the gentleman at all.</p>

<p>Neither my Lady Balmerino nor any person concerned in
her has ever heard any more of this matter. Although Mr.
Walkingshaw has been at pains to make all the enquiry he
could, it has never yet been in his power to make any further
discovery about this affair. My Lady Balmerino is determined
to preserve the letter and the piece of paper that was inclosed,
and if anything cast up relative to the contents of the letter,
her ladyship has been pleased to promise to inform me about
it.</p>

<p class="hanging">[<em>fol.</em> 569.] There is one material circumstance omitted in the Journal
given by Mr. John Cameron, and which ought to come
in after these words,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> '<em>so close to their tents as to hear
every word they spoke</em>.' The material circumstance
omitted is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>When the Prince sent for Donald Cameron of Glenpean, the
said Donald went along with the messenger to the place the
Prince had appointed, and according to the Prince's orders took
along with him all the provisions he had, which was no more
than two or three handfulls of oatmeal and about a pound of
butter. And when the messenger had conducted the said
Donald Cameron to the place appointed for meeting the Prince,
by some accident or other the Prince had left that place and they
missed him. Upon which they were very uneasy and resolved
[<em>fol.</em> 570.]
to go different ways to see to find him out. And there
happening a great fog or mist to come on at that time they
wandered a considerable while in the hill. At last the said
Donald Cameron by mere accident met the Prince, who being
in great want of provisions, the said Donald gave him the oatmeal
and butter he had, of which he ate very heartily, and
which subsisted the Prince and other three persons who were
with him for four days. As the lines of the regular troops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
then all formed with a design to surround the Prince, he advised
with the said Donald Cameron if there was any possibility of
getting through the lines and in what manner. Upon this the
said Donald replied that it was a most hazardous attempt and
next to an impossibility, as the sentries were all placed so
close that they were each of them within speech of the other.
But the Prince being determined to penetrate through the
[<em>fol.</em> 571.]
lines at all hazards, having nothing else left for his escape, the
said Donald told him that there was one pass with a hollow
to go down over a very high rock, which was exceedingly
hazardous, but was the only place he could advise the Prince
to attempt. Upon this they went to the said precipice, being
then dark night, and Donald Cameron went first over the pass
and the Prince followed. But as he was coming down the hill
to the top of the rock where the pass was, his foot slipped, and
the hill being so steep he tumbled to the very top of the rock
and would certainly have fallen one hundred fathoms perpendicular
over the rock had not he catched hold of a tree on the
very top of the rock with one of his legs, after his body passed
the same and which he kept hold of betwixt his leg and his
thigh till the next person that was following catched hold of
[<i>fol.</i> 572.]
him by the breast and held him till the said Donald Cameron
returned back and came to them and recovered both. At last
they got over this so dangerous pass, by which they pass'd the
first line of the troops, and different nights after this they
passed the other four lines of the troops creeping on their
hands and feet betwixt the sentries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="hanging">The above account was taken from the said Donald Cameron
his own mouth, so it can be depended upon.</p>

<p>After this follows the rest of Mr. John Cameron's journal,
the next words being these, 'When they came to Glenmoriston
they got six stout,' etc.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;The proceeding narrative appears to be the same with
that account which Dr. Cameron's lady gave to Dr. Burton
from the best of her remembrance.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>At the same time (December 22nd) I received from Dr.
Cameron's lady a copy of Mr. John Cameron's journal,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and as
the copy I had made my transcript from happened to be very
[<em>fol.</em> 573.]
unexact and confused, so I was not a little desirous to compare
my transcript with that copy which I received from Mrs.
Cameron; and upon comparing them together I found them to
be one and the same, there being no other difference betwixt
them than what ordinarily proceeds from the carelessness and
inaccuracy of transcribers. Even the copy I had from Mrs.
Cameron was none of the correctest as to orthography.</p>

<p>In the course of our conversation Mrs. Cameron said it was
a very remarkable thing that the Prince landed (in his course
from the island Eriska) in Lochnannua, at Boradale in the
country of Arisaig<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and in the parish of Ardnamurchin, and
that at the very same spot he went on board the eight-oar'd
boat after the battle of Culloden, to sail for the isles, that he
was thereafter coming from the Isle of Sky, and likewise that
at the very same spot he imbarked for France upon September
20th, 1746, when he was forced to leave Scotland and to seek

<p>To the King's Most Excellent Majesty the Humble Petition
of George, Lord Rutherford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheweth</span>,&mdash;That your petitioner has always been firmly
attached to your Majesty's royal person and government, and
in testimony thereof was the first man in Britain (for what he

last that the horrid and wicked rebellion was intended. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
as a further proof of his fidelity and loyalty did upon the

George Blair of Castlehill, by three o'clock in the morning,
being informed they were to set out by five o'clock for the
[<em>fol.</em> 575.]
Highlands of Scotland in order to raise all the clans they could
influence to rise in an open rebellion against your Majesty in
favour of a popish pretender.</p>

<p>That your Majesty's petitioner hath been the butt of the
malice of the Jacobites ever since, and was obliged to fly his
own house for fear of his life, they having sent a hundred and
fifty men three different times to his house, who carried off a
great part of his fine armory, cows, and cattle, because they
could not apprehend himself and horses, with which he made
his escape.</p>

<p class="hanging">Therefore your petitioner himself hopes your Majestie will
not only be graciously pleased to order the arrears of
his pension to be paid him, but as a further testimony
of your royal favour, to create him a peer of Great
Britain, and the more especially as he has the honour
to be a remote relation to your Majesty, his grandmother,
[<em>fol.</em> 576.]
the Earl of Teviot's mother, having been niece
to King James the Second of Scotland.</p>

<p>Upon Monday afternoon, December 28th, 1747, Captain
Alexander MacDonald, brother german of Æneas or Angus
MacDonald of Dalely in Moidart, of the family of Clanranald,
and full cousin-german to Miss Flora Macdonald, visited me in
my own room and favoured me with a Journal of several sheets
in his own handwriting, and in the handwriting of young
Clanranald, and in the handwriting of MacDonald of Glenaladale,
the Journal having been drawn up in the presence,
and by the mutual assistance of all the three. By
appointment the said Captain Alexander MacDonald returned
[<em>fol.</em> 577.]
to me next day about nine o'clock in the morning and stayed
with me till near six o'clock at night, in which time I went
through the whole Journal with him at great leisure, not only
the better to prevent my making any mistakes in transcribing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of it, but likewise to have his observations upon some parts to
render them more plain and intelligible to those who are
strangers, either to the subject matter or to the Highlands of
Scotland, and to have his additions to other parts, for he had
told me there were some few omissions of lesser matters. The
whole Journal (from beginning to end) is written in a very
legible and distinct letter and the words are well spelled. At
the same time the said Captain MacDonald gave me his
animadversions upon some parts of other Journals which I read
to him, as will appear hereafter.</p>


<hr class="tb" />



<p>[<em>fol.</em> 578.]
[Now begins the Journal in Captain Alexander MacDonald's

<div class="sidenote">1746
16 April</div>

<p>After the battle of Culloden (which was fought upon the
16th April 1746) his royal highness, attended only by one
Colonel O'Sullivan, Captain Allan MacDonald (a clergyman
of the Church of Rome)<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>, Mr. Alexander MacLeod (one of the
Prince's own <em>aid de camps</em>), and one Ned Burk, came that
night late to Frazer of Gortleg's house in Stratherick,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> where
my Lord Lovat himself stayed at that time. He took some
refreshment there and a couple of hours rest, but went off
before daylight and tooke his route by Fort Augustus and
through Glengary. And though his royal highness was vastly
needful of some recreation there after such fatigue, the disconveniences
of both time and place did not allow any better
accommodations than a piece of a broiled trout he received
[<em>fol.</em> 579.]
there from some well-wisher for his supper at MacDonalds of
Droynachan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 April</div>

<p>Upon Friday's morning, being the 18th, he set off, and held
through Lochharkaig, where he stayed that night with Donald
Cameron of Glenpean, married to MacDonald of Auchtrichatan's
daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">19 April</div>

<p>Upon Saturday's morning, being the 19th, he came to Oban
in Kinlochmors, a corner of Clanranald's estate, and for their
further security contented themselves that night for their
lodgment with a small sheal house near a wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 April</div>

<p>Early upon the 20th his royal highness got up and went
straight to Arisaig to a town called Glenbiastill, where the
Prince got a sute of new Highland cloaths from Angus
MacDonald of Boradale's spouse, the better to disguise him
and to make him pass for one of the country. At Glenbiastill
the few gentlemen (that happened to come home from that
unlucky battle of Culloden) of Clanranald's men assembled
about the Prince, in order to consult and lay their schemes for
[<em>fol.</em> 580.]
his present and future safety, being convinced that the enemy
would probably soon be about them if not resisted. His royal
highness stayed at Glenbiastill for four nights,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and upon the
24th then instant his royal highness concurred in their opinions
that he should leave the mainland and go to the Isles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24 April</div>

<p>Upon the said 24th day, as young Clanranald was absent at
the beginning of their consultation, he finds great fault with his
royal highness's resolution of leaving the continent so abruptly,
but that he should tarry for some time to see what might cast
up; and that he would immediately cause four small bothies to
be built at competent distances in different woods where he
might with all imaginable security skulk for some time, and
that he himself (young Clanranald) and some other chosen
men would take a trip to the Isles to look out for a ship for his
transportation, if seen requisite. But then his royal highness
was so far overswayed by Colonel O'Sullivan, etc., that he
would by no means stay. Upon this young Clanranald
[<em>fol.</em> 581.]
immediately prepares a boat and shippage (Donald MacLeod
of Gualtergill in Sky being appointed pilot and steersman)<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> and
got all things in the best order the place and time could admit
of. And consequently about the 24th then current,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Thursday, they set sail for Uist. The wind blew pretty reev
(<em>i.e.</em> smart or strong) from south-east, that in weathering the
point of Arisaig the bowsprit broke in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> It was a most
terrible dark night, attended with a violent tempest and some
flashes of lightning, and wanting a compass they could not be
sure how they steered their course. But at daybreak they
providentially found themselves within few leagues of their
wished for harbour, and landed at Rossinish in Benbecula<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>,
[<em>fol.</em> 582.]
where the eight-oar'd boat did not stave to pieces for (to put
this matter beyond all doubt) the eight-oar'd boat was lately
brought back again from the Island Skalpay or Glass to the
owner upon the continent, Angus MacDonald of Boradale.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">25 April</div>

<p>About 8 o'clock in the morning they arrived upon the 25th
of April. They refreshed themselves there for three days and
were visited by the old Laird of Clanranald. Upon Monday,
April 28th, early, they set sail for the Lews, ilk one of them
getting borrowed names, his royal highness being called young
Mr. Sinclair, the son, and O'Sullivan, old Mr. Sinclair, the
father,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> and Captain Allan MacDonald (the clergyman as forementioned)
being named Mr. Graham, but the crew retaining
their old designations. But it is to be observed that previous
to the parting with old Clanranald it was thought advisable to
advertise the whole company they should give out among the
Lews people that his royal highness, Colonel O'Sullivan, Captain
Allan MacDonald, and O'Neille were the captain, mate, boatswain,
etc., of a merchant ship shipwreckt at the Isle of Tiry,
and being straitned how to get home to their native country,
the Orkneys, came to Uist, where Clanranald's brother,
[<em>fol.</em> 583.]
MacDonald of Boystil, advised them distrest gentlemen to
embrace the company of his men to the Lews, who were bound
for the town of Stornway there, in order to hire a competent
vessel to carry some meal from the Orkneys to supply the
country. And then, if they should succeed in procuring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
said ship, Mr. MacLeod of Gualtergill would land them at their
own home in the Orkneys still under the borrowed names above
mentioned.</p>

<p>So, after planning their voyage in this order, they set sail for
the Lews as aforesaid upon Monday the 28th, about 6 in the
morning, the wind blowing boisterously from the South-west,
and they landed, Tuesday's morning the 29th, about seven
o'clock, at the Isle of Skalpay, and went to the house of
Donald MacEan Oig, <em>alias</em> Campbell, tenant, married to a
gentlewoman of the name of MacDonald, a rigid loyalist.
They took their repose that night at Skalpay whereof they had
great need.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30 April</div>

<div class="sidenote">May</div>

<p>Upon Wednesday morning, being the 30th of April, they
sent off Donald MacLeod and four Uist people to bespeak a
[<em>fol.</em> 584.]
ship at Stornway in order to concert their meal bargain from
the Orkneys, etc. Mr. MacLeod went thereabout with the
greatest expedition and fidelity, though in the meantime his
conduct thereanent did prove unlucky,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> for after hiring a
sufficient brigg of forty tuns carriage for £100 sterling freight,
and settled all things for sailing off, the master of the ship
would by no means undertake the voyage cheap or dear.
Which turn of affairs so far disordered the whole scheme that
they were now more straitned than ever in their lifetime; for
it seems they scented something about the Prince. However,
Mr. MacLeod tried as his last effort to buy the ship, and engaged
to give £300 for it. 'Tis probable the captain of the
vessel, being tempted by this unexpected offer and his own
poverty, was induced to dispose of the vessel, though he could
scarcely want it (the ship). But through avarice he exacted
£500, which Donald MacLeod's necessity obliged him to promise.
But then the exorbitancy of the sum, together with the unlikelihood
of Mr. MacLeod's ability to be master thereof, suggested
[<em>fol.</em> 585.]
to the seller it was in favour and behoof of the Prince, which
he formerly suspected. The bargain was made, but immediately
he so far resiled therefrom as to deny he would go himself
alongst with them, but would allow the mate and crew to go;
but when these were brought present, they likewise refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
unless the captain would go also. With this the whole project
was blasted at once, and not only so, but the carrying the
affair on thus far did involve them no greater difficulties and
dangers than though they had never broached it; for all kind
of people then began to be of such itching ears and sharpsighted
that his royal highness's being at the Lews began to blaze
abroad. Donald MacLeod, conceiving the imminency and
fatal consequence, without loss of time goes back to his royal
highness at Kildun's house at Arynish and apprized him of the
whole story.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Upon this they took the alarm and go streight
to the yawl they left formerly at Loch Seaforth. As they were
launching it out Captain MacDonald (the Popish Clergyman)<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
[<em>fol.</em> 586.]
asked some of the country people that followed them to the
shore in order to be gazing at them, if there was any amongst
them that would accept of a reasonable præmium for piloting
them to Loch Fraon, an harbour in the shire of Ross, upon the
coast of Seaforth's country, but there was none that would
answer. However the meaning of this question was to suggest
they were bound for that country whereas they were to take a
quite contrary course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 May</div>

<p>They made off late, about six o'clock upon the 5th of May,
those upon the shore noticing their course, but the darkness of
the night favoured them to disappear, and the wind blowing
contrary for their purpose (though favourable for the place
given out to the Lews folks) obliged them to skulk that night
under the covert of a hollow creek in a small Island,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> at the
very foot of the loch called Loch Shelg, where they were
necessitated by a contrary storm to lurk for three nights, having
both the comfort and mortification of seeing some Lews vessel
passing by pretty near them, bound for Loch Fraon in pursuit
of his royal highness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8 May</div>

<div class="sidenote">9 May</div>

<p>Upon Thursday 8th May the wind chopt about to the north
and they were that night on sea. They landed Friday's morning
[<em>fol.</em> 587.]
at Rairnish, near Rossinish in Benbecula, belonging to
Clanranald. They went from Rairnish to Rossinish, where old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Clanranald and his lady came to pay them their respects with
all the accommodations the place could afford. It was consulted
there whether his royal highness could venture to spend
his short time at old Clanranald's house or not.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> But, being
voted by a plurality in the negative, it was determined the
Forrest house in Glen Coridale should be repaired for his use,
a remote private place, yet centrical, both to maintain a free
communication betwixt him and his Uist friends and by its
advantageous situation facilitating his ready access either to
take sea or hill, in case alarmed upon the coming of an enemy,
by the advertisement of their out spies who were planted on
all arts of them. For there was still a boat and skippage in
[<em>fol.</em> 588.]
readiness for his reception in case obliged to take sea, as also
good guides to conduct him through the mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10 May</div>

<p>About the 10th of May 1746, his royal highness with his
small retinue and as little grandeur, repaired to his famous
palace of Coridale (the house in the forest) in South Uist,
attended constantly by Captain Allan MacDonald (Popish
clergyman),<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Colonel O'Sullivan, Mr. O'Neill, the two Rorie's,
and Alexander and John MacDonalds, all formerly his royal
highness's officers in Clanranald's regiment, with a dozen of
other sturdy clever fellows that served as guard, and running
several incident errands back and forward. These were all the
people that stuck constantly to his royal highness at Coridale.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>


<div class="sidenote">10 June</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 589.] In the Forrest house the Prince (when resting himself) used
to sit on a fail-sunk, <em>i.e.</em> an earthen seat, having some fog and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
plaids under him, and would step into a by-chamber, which
served as a pantry, and (when he stood in need of it) put the
bottle of brandy or whiskie to his head and take his dram
without any ceremony. Upon the 10th day of June MacDonald
of Boystil,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Hugh MacDonald of Bailshair in North Uist, of
the family of Slate, James and Lauchlan MacDonalds, brothers
of the often mentioned Captain Alexander MacDonald, and
Ranald MacDonald of Torulum of Clanranald's family, visited
the Prince in his Forrest palace,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> to pay him the compliments
of the day. Their drink was only cold brandy out of a clean
shell without any mixture at all, and the Prince stood it out
better than any one of them in drinking the health of the day.
The foresaid Hugh MacDonald of Bailshair is that gentleman
whom Miss MacDonald pitched upon as the Prince's guardian<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
for his greater safety, but who refused the important trust from
[<em>fol.</em> 590.]
fear of the great dangers attending it.</p>

<p>The island of South Uist is reckoned the only country best
for game in all Scotland, where all species of wild fowls are in
great plenty besides deer, etc.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> His royal highness was pretty
oft at his diversion through the mountain, papping down
perhaps dozens in a day of muircocks and hens, with which this
place abounds; for he is most dextrous at shooting all kinds of
fowl upon wing, scarce ever making a miss.</p>

<p>His magnanimous spirit bore all crosses and adversities with
the greatest Christian resignation and manly courage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<p>Now his royal highness's greatest danger was an invasion
from Clanronald's continent where then the throng of all his
pursuers encamped. And as the enemy were persuaded he
once came to their rough countries of Clanronald's, viz.,
Moidart, etc., it was natural for them to guess he would pass
to the outmost recess of his isles as being environ'd by the sea
and consequently a faster refuge. The old laird of Clanronald
being pretty oft in his company, the prudent, old, reverend sage
[<em>fol.</em> 591.]
did now and then apprehend the dreadful danger that aye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
impended his royal highness's constant abode in an isle, and did
(with others) signifie the same to him. But he would not be
dissuaded from continuing in South Uist till farther account.
Upon this old Clanranald thought it advisable to go to the
continent to dive into the doings there, and in case of any
apparent danger to advertise his royal highness; all which he
did. The people of Uist would have prest him more than they
did to leave the island, were it not they feared he might think
it was more for their own safety than for the delivery of him
they would be so importunate.</p>

<p>About the latter end of June Captain Ferguson landed at
Barra with some hundreds of red-coats. Three hundred of the
MacLeods of Sky likewise at the same time arrived at Benbecula,
all in quest of his royal highness. General Campbell
with a squadron had gone about to St. Gilda, the remotest of
all the western Isles, the Laird of MacLeod proprietor, and
[<em>fol.</em> 592.]
from thence was to come to Uist. Besides all this the channel
between Uist, Skie, and Canna was all full of ships and scooners,
so that at once his royal highness and his few adherents were
to be attacked from all quarters environed by sea and land.</p>

<p>It was now full time to concert measures for the evading this
prominent danger; upon which they sent off Lieutenant
John MacDonald (nephew to Captain Alexander MacDonald
frequently mentioned) to the south end of the country to
reconnoitre Captain Ferguson's motions, and sent Lieutenant
Rory MacDonald (brother of the said John MacDonald) to the
north end to observe and bring message of the route of the
MacLeods; and appointed that both these messengers should
tryst them at Lochboystil, a centrical place for making use of
any future resolution. The gentlemen came back at the
appointed time and place, and told that these two parties were
to march forward from both the ends of the Isle in search of
the Prince till they would meet in the midst of the country.</p>

<p>The Almighty only knows, and the Divine dispenser of
human providence allennarly knows, what inexpressible perplexity
[<em>fol.</em> 593.]
of mind and anguish of soul and body his royal highness
and his small retinue laboured under when taking it into their
serious consideration that they were now encompassed by no
less than three or four thousand bloody hounds, by sea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
land, thirsting for the captivity and noble blood of their Prince,
the apparent heir of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, and
that none of the many thousands that should be in readiness
to relieve him at the expence of their lives were then about
him either to protect or advise him, but only one O'Sullivan,
one O'Neille, and twelve MacDonalds, and that very handfull
to be disposed on different posts for fear of being suspected for
such a number. However, Providence directed them to the
top of a hill called Beinchillkoinnich in South Uist, from
whose eminence they might have an ample prospect. They
here formed themselves into a committee to consult for the
most expeditious methods to leave Uist (though late) and it
[<em>fol.</em> 594.]
was here they pitched upon the stratagem of getting Miss
MacDonald;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and then they severed till they came to the
shealling called Alisary within a mile to Milntoun, where Flora
MacDonald lived as housekeeper to her brother, young Milntoun.
At first the young woman was surprized, but then when
spoke to sincerely did condescend to go with his royal highness
through the vast world if it should contribute in the least to
his safety. She goes off to Benbecula where the lady Clanranald
was desired to have suitable cloaths for Bettie Burk who
was engaged in the station of a servant with Flora MacDonald
to go with her to the Isle of Sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28 June</div>

<div class="sidenote">26 June</div>

<p>The Lady Clanranald upon the advertisement of this noble
stratagem provides all necessaries for getting Mrs. Burk cled
suitable to her new servile station, and after getting all things
in due order that were proper for Mrs. Burk and her mistress,
they both go off to Lochuiskava in Benbecula, where his royal
highness, Lieutenant John MacDonald, Rory and Alexander
MacDonalds, ensigns, Little Rory MacDonald (John's brother)
[<em>fol.</em> 595.]
and some other Uist hands met them with a small shallop of a
boat of about nine cubits, wright measure, in full readiness to
take sea. It was about St. Peter's feast, the 28th of June.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The
Lady Clanranald begged of his royal highness to try on his new
female apparel, and after mutually passing some jocose drollery
concerning the sute of cloaths, and the lady shedding some tears
for the occasion, the said lady dresses up his royal highness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
his new habit.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> It was on purpose provided coarse as it was to
be brooked by a gentlewoman's servant. The gown was of caligo,
a light coloured quilted petticoat, a mantle of dun camlet
made after the Irish fashion with a cap to cover his royal
highness whole head and face, with a suitable head-dress, shoes,
stockings, etc. So that about 8 o'clock in the evening of
Thursday, June 26th, his royal highness, etc. moved towards
the boat, where he took leave of the Lady Clanranald most
kindly.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 596.]
It is to be observed that some days before this Donald MacLeod,
as also Captain Allan MacDonald and Colonel Sullivan
parted from his royal highness at the side of Lochboystil. Sullivan
dropt several tears and loudly roar'd when parting with his
master. Then all the company was dismist that could not
speak Erse but O'Neille, and O'Neille himself two days ere they
went off to Skie.</p>

<p>His royal highness at parting with the Lady Clanranald
thanks her for her great trouble about him. They<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> go to sea
about 8 o'clock at night, and as they had but a small breeze
in their sail they made but a very little progress; so that
about one o'clock afternoon next day they were inclosed with
a prodigious thick fog which made them think it dangerous to
continue rowing for fear they might err in their course and
perhaps unawares approach the coast of Skie, which they were
informed was all hemmed with guards of the enemy to prevent
[<em>fol.</em> 597.]
his royal highness's landing, and being safe. So it was thought
proper to drop in the oars till the mist dissipated; and soon
afterwards the fog disperst by a feeble caver (<em>i.e.</em> a breeze) of
north-easterly wind against them. They mistook the point
of Snod for the point of Watternish; but as they were obliged
to row close to the shore for a shelter from the wind that blew
sidling, they descry pretty near them, about a musket-shot, a
number of men under arms, and to the number of fifty armed
men sallying out of a formall guard-house, all rushing to the
shore, crying vehemently to land upon their peril. Upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
they only changed their course a little further from the shore
and did not much pull their oars better than before for fear of
suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29 June</div>

<p>Lieutenant John MacDonald (nephew of Captain Alexander
MacDonald) sat at the helm, and the other four MacDonalds
wrought most strenuously at the oars, pulling them most
industriously but without the least disorder or hurry. But as
the guard saw no appearance of their obeying orders they let
fly a thick volley at them, which made more noise than harm.
[<em>fol.</em> 598.]
His royal highness rubs up their courage not to fear the
villains. The people replied they maintain'd no fear upon
their own account if Providence should rescue his royal highness.
He repeats no fear of him. Indeed the people were apt
to believe all he could say, God aye working on patent passages
for their safety from time to time. But having seen three<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
boats on the shore, they were mighty apprehensive they would
pursue them. However, they wrought the boat to the utmost
of their endeavours, doubled the tedious point of Watternish,
and by this they left all MacLeod's country behind them.
And though Sir Alexander MacDonald did not join his royal
highness they were sure to meet with greater favour among
the worst of his men than among the cold MacLeods. Besides
that, MacDonald of Kingsburgh was trysted<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> to meet his royal
[<em>fol.</em> 599.]
highness upon the shore of Modhstot, Sir Alexander's habitation.
They landed upon the 29th of June, Sunday, at
Modhstot Bay, where Kingsburgh met them exactly as soon
as they footed Skie. He directs Miss MacDonald and Mrs.
Burk<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> to his own house; Clanranald's people that brought his
royal highness from Uist were desired by himself to turn
home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30 June</div>

<p>His royal highness lodged that night at Kingsburgh. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Kingsburgh he went to Portree,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> where Captain Malcolm
MacLeod received him and conducted him to the Island of
Raisa, and from thence back again to Skie, where he delivered
him over into the hands of the old Laird of MacKinnon, who
without loss of time provided him in a boat. The old Laird
and four of his men, viz., John MacRory VicLauchlan, Calum
M<sup>c</sup>Ean Yairs, etc., ferryed his royal highness over from Skie
to a place called Buarblach in Glengary's lands. He was but
two or three nights upon the MacKinnon's lands. Here it is
[<em>fol.</em> 600.]
to be observed, though he happened to be landed upon Glengarie's
lands, that he would by no means go to Knoydart,
which was very near him, nor to Lochabar, but chused to
strike directly to Clanranald's<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> continent to a place called
Cross in Morror, from whence he was received and conveyed
by Angus MacDonald of Boradale,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> the first house he entred in
the Highlands at his first landing upon the continent.</p>

<p>The night before the 10th of July,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> his royal highness set sail
from MacKinnon's country, accompanied by old MacKinnon,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
and another gentleman of MacKinnon's name (viz., John MacKinnon,
a captain in his royal highness's service before), with
the crew, and landed by daybreak next morning, being the
eleventh, at a bay in Glengary's Morror, where he stayed all
that day and the following night. There are two Morors, the
[<em>fol.</em> 601.]
one belonging to Glengary and the other to Clanranald.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12 July</div>

<div class="sidenote">13 July</div>

<div class="sidenote">15 July</div>

<p>Early in the morning upon the 12th, MacKinnon parting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
him, he (the Prince) sailed into Loch-Naives,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> when, as he was
turning at a point he was met by some of the Slate militia,
who put the ordinary questions. From whence they came?
Where they were bound? And they undauntedly answering
suitable to the time, the militia let them pass without taking
further notice. His royal highness pursued farther into the
loch, and how soon he got out of sight of them, he landed, and
travelling the remainder of the day and the following night
through hills and woods, he arrived upon the thirteenth of July
in that part of Clanranald's estate called Moror, where being
received by the Laird of Moror (MacDonald, of the family
of Clanranald, and lieutenant-colonel of the Clanranald regiment)
in a small hut, where he lived for the time, his own
houses being burned by the enemy sometime before, and having
refreshed himself there that night and the next day as well as
these troublesome times could afford, he set out the night
[<em>fol.</em> 602.]
betwixt the 14th and 15th, accompanied by Captain MacKinnon
and a guide, and arrived before day at Boradale,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> the
place of his first landing, and was there received by Angus
MacDonald of that place, who, having his houses burnt and
effects destroyed by the troops under General Campbell's
command, was obliged to remove with his royal highness to a
hut in a neighbouring wood, where he refreshed him the best
way he could for three days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 July</div>

<p>Upon the 18th of July his royal highness wrote a private
letter (by John MacDonald, junior, son of the foresaid Angus
MacDonald of Boradale, and a lieutenant formerly in Clanranald's
regiment) to Alexander MacDonald of Glenaladale,
major to Clanranald in his royal highness's service, and who
was well known to his royal highness before, commanding his
attendance at the foresaid place to concert measures for his
royal highness's safety.</p>

<p>Angus MacDonald of Boradale had two sons of the name of
John, viz., John, senior, and John, junior, the former of whom
was killed at Culloden battle.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after sending off the above-mentioned express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 603.]
his royal highness got an account of MacKinnon's being taken,
which made it, he judged proper, for his royal highness to
remove, upon the 18th, four miles to the eastward to an
inaccessible cave (known to very few of the country people),
accompanied by the said Angus MacDonald of Boradale and his
son (Ranald, formerly lieutenant to Clanranald's own company),
where he was to stay till Glenaladale should join him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 July</div>

<p>On the 20th of July at night, Glenaladale met with the
foresaid Angus Macdonald at the place they had formerly
agreed upon, from whence he was conducted to his royal highness.
On the 21st, Angus MacDonald got a letter from a son-in-law
of his own, acquainting that it was whispered about the
country that his royal highness was with them, and representing
how dangerous it was for them to stay any longer there, and
making an offer of a place he had prepared, where they might
be more secure for some time. Accordingly Ranald MacDonald
[<em>fol.</em> 604.]
was sent to reconnoitre the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22 July</div>

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<p>Upon the 22nd of July, Lieutenant John MacDonald being
sent to view the sea-coast and to learn something of the
enemy's motions, he returned with the news of their seeing a
small boat, something like one of the enemy's tenders, which
allarmed that side of the coast. Upon which his royal highness
judged it proper to remove from his grotto (without waiting
the return of the quartermaster he sent the day before to take
up his lodgings) in order to repair to the place prepared for
him in the Glen of Moror. His royal highness, being accompanied
by Major MacDonald of Glenaladale, Angus MacDonald
of Boradale, and his son, John, junior, when they came to a
place called Corrybeinicabir, they were met by Angus MacDonald's
son-in-law, who, as above mentioned, had a place
prepared for them in the Glen of Moror,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and who informed
that young Clanranald was within a few miles of them, who had
come to where he then was, in order to conduct his royal
[<em>fol.</em> 605.]
highness to a safe place he had prepared for him: but his royal
highness and his small party having gone on too far towards
their designed quarters, and it being late to go where Clanranald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
was or to send for him that night, they went on,
supposing they would have time enough next day to send for
Clanranald. Accordingly they pursued their journey to the
Glen of Moror, and sent Angus MacDonald to provide some
necessaries. Upon his royal highness's arrival at his quarters,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
an information was brought that General Campbell, with six
men-of-war, well furnished with troops, had anchored at Loch
Naives (the place where his royal highness landed from Skie in
Glengary's country), whereupon two men were sent off by Loch
Moror to Loch Naives to observe General Campbell's motions.
But before they had time to return, Angus MacDonald came
back upon the 23rd early, without waiting for the necessaries
[<em>fol.</em> 606.]
he went for, and brought intelligence that Captain Scott had
come to the lower part of Arisaig from Glengary's Moror.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July</div>

<p>His royal highness and the small company that was with him,
finding upon this information that Clanranald's country was
surrounded on all sides by the troops, and that in all probability
there could be no further security for his person in that country,
it was resolved that his royal highness should leave it with the
utmost dispatch, especially since it was impossible to join young
Clanranald,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> the enemy being already between them and the
place where he was. Accordingly he sets out, accompanied
only by Major MacDonald of Glenaladale and his brother
(Lieutenant John MacDonald), and the other Lieutenant John
MacDonald, junior, Boradale's son, being obliged to part with
Angus MacDonald of Boradale, and his son-in-law (Angus
MacEachine), surgeon formerly to Glengary's regiment, that
they might the more easily pass undiscovered by the guards
placed on their way,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and by twelve o'clock they came to the
[<em>fol.</em> 607.]
top of a hill in the outmost bounds of Arisaig called Scoorvuy,
where having taken some refreshment it was thought proper to
send Lieutenant John MacDonald (Glenaladale's brother) to
Glenfinin, the outmost bounds of Clanranald's country, and
Major MacDonald of Glenaladale's property, as well for intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
as to bring two men Glenaladale kept still on guard
there, and appointed them to meet him about ten o'clock at
night on the top of a hill, above Lochharkaig in Lochiel's
country, called Scoorwick Corrichan.</p>

<p>Lieutenant MacDonald being sent off, his royal highness set
out, and by two o'clock came to the top of a neighbouring hill
called Fruighvein, where, observing some cattle in motion, his
royal highness and the other Lieutenant MacDonald stood
back, and Major MacDonald of Glenaladale went to examine
what that might mean; who upon examination found this to
be some of his own tenants removing with their cattle from the
troops, who by this time, to the number of five or seven hundred,
[<em>fol.</em> 608.]
had come to the head of Lochharkaig, in order to inclose his
royal highness in Clanranald's country, while the search was
going on very narrowly within it. This being the route they
were resolved to hold, pretty much disconcerted their measures.
Major MacDonald of Glenaladale bringing back word to his
royal highness of what he had heard, they resolved to alter
their course, and accordingly the Major sent off one of his own
tenants express to Glenfinnan about a mile off, to call back
Lieutenant MacDonald and the guard if he had found them,
and sent another of his tenants to an adjacent hill for one
Donald Cameron of Glenpean,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> where he had removed with his
effects upon the approach of the troops, in order to learn from
the said Donald Cameron the situation of the forces that were
at Fort Augustus, and if he would undertake to guide his royal
highness by their guards, if possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23 July</div>

<div class="sidenote">24 July</div>

<p>While his royal highness and Major MacDonald of Glenaladale,
with Lieutenant MacDonald (Boradale's son), waited
the return of both the expresses, one of the Major's tenant's
wives, regreting the condition she saw him in, and willing to
refresh him the best she could (she suspecting nothing of his
[<em>fol.</em> 609.]
royal highness being in company with him), milked some of her
cattle, and brought the fresh milk to them. Upon observing
the woman coming up to them, the Prince covered his head
with a handkerchief and passed for one of the Major's servants
that had got an ache in his head. Notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
refreshment was very seasonable, the day being excessively hot,
they could very well have dispensed with the good woman's
compliment. However, the Major thanked her and used some
policy to dismiss her, having first taken care to have some of
the milk reserved for his royal highness, which he drank with
pleasure. Soon after the express sent to Glenfinnan returned,
but could find neither Lieutenant MacDonald (Glenaladale's
brother), nor the two men, they having run express with
intelligence to where they expected to have found the Major.
The said express brought word that a hundred of the Argyleshire
militia had come to the very foot of the hill where his
[<em>fol.</em> 610.]
royal highness stayed; whereupon it was thought proper to
tarry no longer there; and, as there was no time to wait for
Donald Cameron, their expected guide, trusting in the great
Guide that directs all, his royal highness, full of courage and
confidence, set out about sun-setting with his small retinue, and
travelled pretty hard till about eleven o'clock at night, when,
passing thro' a hollow between two hills, they observed a
man coming down one of the hills. Upon which his royal
highness and Lieutenant MacDonald (Boradale's son), stept
aside, and Major MacDonald of Glenaladale<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> went to the man
to examine whether he might be a friend or a foe, and as Providence
would have it, found him to be their intended guide,
Donald Cameron, whom after some short conversation he
conducted to his royal highness. Donald Cameron gave a
relation so far as he knew of the situation of the forces, and
undertook to guide them by the guards. Upon this they
[<em>fol.</em> 611.]
pursued their way through roads almost impassable even in
day light, and travelling all night they came at four o'clock in
the morning upon the 24th of July to the top of a hill in the
Brae of Lochharkaig, called Mamnynleallum, from whence they
could (without the help of a prospective glass) discern their
enemy's camp, being not above a mile distant. But being
informed by the guide that that hill was searched the day
before by the troops, they supposed there would not be a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
search that day, and therefore they resolved to pass the day
there; and choosing the fastest place in the hill they took a
little rest. After two hours sleep the Major, Lieutenant MacDonald,
and the guide got up to keep sentry, and by ten
o'clock of the day they observed a man at a distance, and as the
guide (Donald Cameron) being in his own country, and very
near his own place of residence, knew the inhabitants best, he
was sent to converse with that man, and upon examination
[<em>fol.</em> 612.]
found him to be Lieutenant MacDonald, Glenaladale's brother,
who not meeting his royal highness at the place appointed and
getting no intelligence of the enemy's being so near till he
himself came within sight of their camp, he turned apprehensive
of what might happen to be the case, and regretting his misfortune
in parting with his royal highness, went on wherever
Providence directed him, which (most happily) brought him
directly to the place where the Prince was, who was well pleased
to find the lieutenant safe, as the whole company had given
him over for lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25 July</div>

<p>His royal highness continued in the top of the said hill all
that day, and about nine o'clock at night set out with his
retinue to the northward, and by one o'clock in the morning of
July 25th, came to a place called Corrinangaull on the confines
betwixt that part of Glengary's country called Knoydart, and
that part of Lochiel's country called Lochharkaig, where the
guide expected some Lochharkaig people to have fled with their
[<em>fol.</em> 613.]
effects, whom he had confidence in, and which was very much
desired, as they had entirely run out of provisions, excepting a
very small quantity of oatmeal, and as small a remainder of
butter, which they could not dress or prepare in any shape, as
they travelled continually (for the most part) in view of the
enemy if in day light;<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> their camps being (in a direct line pitched
from the head of the Lochiel in Lochiel's country to the head
of Loch Uirn, dividing Knoydart of that part of MacLeod's
country called Glenealg), within half a mile's distance of one
another, their sentries being placed within call of one another,
and patrols going about every quarter of an hour to keep their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
sentries alert, that so his royal highness might be surely catched
should he attempt to pass through them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26 July</div>

<p>Being pinched in provisions as above, his royal highness stood
back with the two lieutenants, while Major MacDonald of
Glenaladale and the guide (Donald Cameron of Glenpean) went
[<em>fol.</em> 614.]
to some shealing huts where they expected to meet some people.
But finding none, they chused a fast place in the face of a
hill at the head of Lochqhuaigh, to which fastness they came
about two o'clock in the morning, having only about a mile in
walking to it. After taking an hour's rest there, the guide and
Lieutenant MacDonald (Glenaladale's brother) were sent off to
the hill above them to furnish some provisions if possible, the
Major and his cousin, the other lieutenant (Boradale's son),
standing sentries, while his royal highness took some rest.
When the sun shined they observed distinctly a camp pitched
at the head of Lochqhuaig, and though they did not like the
prospect they waited the return of their provisors, who came
back to them about 3 o'clock, having got only two small
cheeses, that would not be a morsel to the piece of them; and
brought intelligence that about one hundred of the red-coats
were marching up the other side of the hill his royal highness
[<em>fol.</em> 615.]
lodged in, in order to destroy and carry off such of the poor
inhabitants as had fled to the hill for shelter. Notwithstanding
this alarm (the search for his royal highness being general and
very narrow all around), they stayed in the same place till
about eight o'clock at night, when, setting out, his royal highness
travelled stoutly till it became dark, and climbing a steep
hill called Drimachosi to the top,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> they observed the fires of a
camp directly in their front, which they could scarcely shun, at
Glenqhosy. However, being resolved to pass at any rate, they
came so near without being observed as to hear them talk
distinctly; and ascending the next hill, no sooner was his royal
highness at the top than he and his small party spied the fires
of another camp at the very foot where they were to descend.
But turning a little westward they passed between two of their
guards betwixt one and two o'clock in the morning of July
[<em>fol.</em> 616.]
26th. After travelling two miles, as they judged, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
them, they came, betwixt two and three o'clock in the morning,
to a place on the Glenealg side of the head of Lochuirn called
Corriscorridill,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> where having chosen a fast place they took such
refreshment as the exigency of the time afforded them, his royal
highness covering a slice of cheese with oatmeal, which, though
but dry fare, he ate very comfortably, and drank of the cold
stream along with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27 July</div>

<p>His royal highness passed the whole day in the above place
till about eight o'clock at night, and the guide (Donald
Cameron), knowing the road no further in the course the Prince
intended to hold, he expected to find some people thereabouts
he could trust. Glenaladale and the guide accordingly went
about in order to find them; but no sooner did they get out of
their fasthold than they found they had lodged all day within
a canon-shot of two small camps, and spied a company of
red-coats getting in some muttons to a cot and chusing out some
[<em>fol.</em> 617.]
for slaughter. Upon which they brought<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> back word to his
royal highness of what they had seen. Upon this his royal
highness set out, and by three o'clock in the morning of July
27th they came to Glensheil in Seaforth's country. As they
had run out entirely of their last supply of provisions, the
Major and Lieutenant John MacDonald (Boradale's son) were
sent off as well to furnish some as to provide a guide to conduct
them to Pollieu in Seaforth's country, where his royal highness
had heard some French vessels to have been; and coming to
the place where the inhabitants were, the Major bought some
provisions, and made application to one of the inhabitants for
a guide, which he undertook to provide. In the meantime
that the Major was talking about the guide, a Glengary man
appears coming towards them who that morning had been
chased by the troops (they having killed his father the day
[<em>fol.</em> 618.]
before) from Glengary to Glensheil. Upon seeing this man the
Major knew him, who upon conversing with him found him to
have formerly served in his royal highness's army, and conceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
him to be a trusty fellow, resolved to make use of him<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> as a
reserve in case they should be disappointed of the intended
guide, and would be thereby obliged to alter their course,
though at the same time Glenaladale did not disclose his mind
to the Glengary man.</p>

<p>The Major after furnishing what provisions he could get,
returned to where his royal highness was, and taking some
refreshments, they went to the face of an adjacent hill to take
some rest and sleeping, till about four or five o'clock in the
afternoon, when they got up and dismist their old faithful
guide, Donald Cameron.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Soon after whose departure, the
Major, upon seeing the Glengary man passing by on his way to
his country, slipt out of his den and brought him to a byplace,
till he would be sure about his intended guide, and returning
to his royal highness consulted with him what should be done
[<em>fol.</em> 619.]
in regard of the Glengary men, and the Prince approved of
keeping by him till their fate with regard to their other guide
should be known. About seven o'clock at night, the man who
undertook to furnish the guide was seen coming to the place
which had been appointed for meeting at betwixt him and the
Major, who immediately stept out to the place appointed, and
after some conversation he found that the only French ship
that had been there was gone off, and that no guide could be
procured. The Major finding it needless to proceed further
towards Poolieu made the man believe that he intended to
return again to his own country and so dismist him.</p>

<p>Immediately Glenaladale returned to the Prince and told
him what had passed; whereupon it was resolved to change
their course, and accordingly the Glengary man was introduced
to his royal highness, and most chearfully undertook to guide
[<em>fol.</em> 620.]
him. And, preparing to pursue their journey, they set out late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
at night, and going on about a quarter of a mile, they stopt a
little, which was occasioned by the Major's clapping his hand to
his side and missing his purse,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> wherein he had another purse
of gold he had got the charge of from his royal highness in
order to defray his charges, and which he had forgot when
they had been preparing for their journey. Upon this Glenaladale
and Lieutenant MacDonald (Boradale's son) returned,
and coming to the place found his purse, but opening it miss'd
the inner purse in which the gold he had got from the Prince
was contain'd. In the midst of his surprize he reflected it might
have been taken away by a little boy sent by their landlord,
Gilchrist MacCrath, with a compliment of milk, as the landlord
supposed to the Major, who had not allowed him to know
anything about the Prince at all. He was the more confirmed
in this opinion, as they had left the boy at the place where the
[<em>fol.</em> 621.]
purse was forgot. Accordingly the Major and Lieutenant
MacDonald went all the way to MacCrath's house, which was
more than a mile off, and calling for him represented to him
the inconveniency of the accident that had happened, and
intreated him to oblige the boy to restore the purse, which he
did to a trifle. They returned by a different road from what
they had gone before, and came to the Prince, who was in great
pain for them, fearing they might have been intercepted by an
officer and two private men that pass'd under arms by the place
where his royal highness was in their absence; which made him
reflect how much the hand of Providence guided him in all his
ways,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and particularly in this late lucky accident of losing
the purse, which stopt them in their progress: whereas if they
had pursued their journey they would inevitably have fallen in
with these persons, in which case any thinking person may
[<em>fol.</em> 622.]
easily judge how fatal the consequence of such a meeting might
have proved. The Prince likewise used to think much upon
the happy undesigned event of his enemies, chasing a guide to
him for no less than thirty miles whom Providence led in his
way to conduct him safe out of their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">28 July</div>

<p>Having once more got together, his royal highness and his
small retinue set out, and travelling all the remainder of the
night came early in the morning of July 28th to a hill-side
above Strathchluaine, and, chusing a fast place, took some rest
till towards three o'clock afternoon, when they set out, and
travelling by a hill-side about a mile from the place they rested
in, they heard the firing of small arms in the hill above them,
which they judged to be some of the troops chasing people that
had fled with their effects. They steered their course northward,
and mounting up a high hill betwixt the Braes of Glenmoriston
and Strathglass came late at night to the very top of
[<em>fol.</em> 623.]
it, and being very dark they were obliged to lodge there all
night, the only shelter his royal highness could have being an
open cave where he could neither lean nor sleep, being wet to
the skin with the heavy rain that had fallen the day before;
and having no fuel to make a fire, the only method he had of
warming himself was smoking a pipe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29 July</div>

<p>About three o'clock in the morning of July 29th the
Lieutenant (Glenaladale's brother) and the guide (the providential
Glengary man) were sent in quest of some trusty
people they intended to find out in order to conduct his royal
highness to Pollieu,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> and were appointed to return to the top
of a neighbouring hill where his royal highness and the
remainder of his retinue were to meet them. Accordingly
about five o'clock in the morning his royal highness set out,
[<i>fol.</i> 624.]
and by seven came to the top of that hill, where meeting with
the guide on his return he told he had found out his intended
trustees,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> who had given him directions to the Major (they
knowing nothing at all of his royal highness, only suspecting
that a young man they were told was in company might be
young Clanranald) to repair into a cave in the Brae of Glenmoriston
in a place called Coiraghoth, where they promised to
come at an appointed hour with a refreshment. Accordingly
his royal highness set out, and by the time appointed came to
the place and meeting with these few friends (who upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
sight<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> knew his royal highness, having formerly served in his army)
they conducted him to the grotto where he was refreshed with
such chear as the exigency of the time afforded; and making a
bed for him, his royal highness was lulled asleep with the sweet
murmurs of the finest purling stream that could be, running
[<em>fol.</em> 625.]
by his bedside, within the grotto, in which romantic habitation<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
his royal highness pass'd three days, at the end of which he
was so well refreshed<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> that he thought himself able to encounter
any hardships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">6 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">7 Aug.</div>

<p>Having time in that space to provide some necessaries and
to gather intelligence about the enemy's motions, they removed,
on the 2d of August, into a place within two miles of them,
called Coirmheadhain,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> where they took up their habitation in
a grotto no less romantic than the former. After taking some
refreshment, they placed their sentries and made up a bed for
his royal highness in a closet shaped out by nature, and seemingly
designed by her for the reception of his royal highness.
He rested comfortably all night. In this place he resided four
days; but, being informed that one Campbell (factor to Seaforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
in Kintale, and captain at that time of a company of militia)
had gathered a throng herdship of cattle and pitched his camp
within four miles of them, it was then resolved his royal highness
[<em>fol.</em> 626.]
should remove his quarters. Accordingly, upon the 6th of
August, he set out to the northward, and, by break of day upon
the 7th, came in upon the Brae of the Chisholm's country,
called Strathglass, having left one of their party behind in
the Brae of Glenmoriston to wait Campbell's motions.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> That
friend came up to them that night (August 7th) and brought
word that they needed not be afraid for that night. Upon
this his royal highness repaired to a neighbouring sheally hut,
when they prepared a fire, and, taking some refreshment, they
made up a bed for his royal highness, which consisted of a long
divot or fail (that was found lying in the hut) of six or seven
foot long; and, laying it flat upon the floor, the grass side
uppermost, with a pillow of the same kind, his royal highness
slept on the earthen bed all night. They remained in this
place two days, and in that time the prince sent an express to
Pollieu<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> to know the certainty about some French vessels being
there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9 Aug.</div>

<div class="sidenote">10 Aug.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 627.] Early in the morning of August 9th, his royal highness set
out to the northward so far on his way to Pollieu in case of
any encouragement<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> from that quarter, and, travelling a muir
road unfrequented, came that night into another sheally hut,
about the distance of five or six miles from where they had set
out. There they remained all night, and set out about two
o'clock in the morning of August 10th, and came about twelve
o'clock into a place called Glencanna, where, passing the
remainder of the day in a wood, they repaired late at night to
a neighbouring village, where they stayed only the dead of
night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11 Aug.</div>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning of August 11th, they set
out and climbed a hill on the northmost side of Glencanna,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
where they pass'd the day and sent off two of their party to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
furnish a fresh supply of provisions. At night they repaired
into a neighbouring sheally hut, where they remained two days,
[<em>fol.</em> 628.]
expecting the return of the express sent off to Pollieu, who
accordingly came to them and brought back word that the only
French ship that had come there had sailed off again, and that
a couple of gentlemen who had come on board of her had
actually landed and were making the best of their way for
Lochiel's country in search of the Prince.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> He, becoming
anxious to know if they had dispatches for him, resolved to
return towards the place from whence he had come in order to
meet with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13 Aug.</div>

<p>August 13th, at night, they set out cross the water of
Canna back again, and boldly by young Chisholm's house,
came by two o'clock in the morning to a place called Fassanacoill
in Strathglass; and, consulting what was best and fittest
to be done, it was resolved (before his royal highness should
venture any further) to send some spies to the Braes of Glengary
and Lochiel's country, in order to get sure information
[<em>fol.</em> 629.]
whether or not the search for him in these bounds was all over,
and if the troops had gone into their camp at Fort Augustus,
which being done, his royal highness remained there for three
days in a very fast wood, the inhabitants dreaming nothing of
his being so near them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17 Aug.</div>

<p>They waited the return of the spies, who brought notice
that the forces had returned to their camp. Whereupon his
royal highness set out by six o'clock in the morning of August
17th, travelled through an unfrequented road, and came by ten
o'clock to the Braes of Glenmoriston, and, passing the day on
the top of a hill, they set out at night, and had not travelled
above a mile when they learned that a strong party had been
detached to the Braes of Glengary in quest of the Prince.
Upon this it was resolved to proceed no further on their
journey untill the motion of the enemy should be farther
known; and then they repaired into a neighbouring sheally
[<em>fol.</em> 630.]
hut, where they passed the remainder of the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 Aug.</div>

<p>Upon August 18th, in the morning, three expresses were
sent off&mdash;two to Lochiel's country, Lochharkaig, who were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
seek out Cluns Cameron,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> and to tell him from Major MacDonald
of Glenaladale that he wanted to meet with him in a
convenient place; and the third express was to return at the
Brae of Glengary and to bring back word if the party they
were informed of the night before had returned to their camp
or not; that so, if the road should happen to be clear, his
royal highness might be pursuing his journey, even while the
meeting betwixt the Major and Cluns Cameron was a concerting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19 Aug.</div>

<p>Accordingly the expresses were sent off, and, upon the 19th,
the one that was to return brought word that the road was
clear. Whereupon the Prince and his small party, being then
ten in number, set out under the advantage of a foggy afternoon,
[<em>fol.</em> 631.]
and, passing through Glenmoriston and Glenlyne, came
late at night to the Brae of Glengary. In their way to the
water of Gary, the rain came on so heavy that the water swell'd
to a great height. Two of the company went first to try if
they could wade the water, and they found it passable, even
though it came up to their very middle. Whereupon, his royal
highness and the rest of his party entering the water, they
forded it safely, and, travelling about a mile from the water of
Gary, the night being very dark, they were obliged to pass
it on the side of a hill, without any cover, though it rained
excessively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20 Aug.</div>

<p>In the morning of August 20th the Prince set out, the rain
still continuing very heavy, and, travelling six miles cross hills
and muirs, came about ten o'clock to the Brae of a place called
Achnasaul,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> where the other expresses had been appointed to
meet them. There they pass'd the day in a most inconvenient
[<em>fol.</em> 632.]
habitation, it raining as heavy within as without it. Towards
the afternoon they began to despair about their expresses, and,
being entirely run out of provisions of any kind and being
quite strangers to the situation of Lochiel's country for the
present, they began to concert what should be done, when, in
the midst of their concert, the expresses came to them and
brought word to the Major that Cameron of Cluns could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
wait upon him that night, but had directed him to lodge all
night in a certain wood within two miles of them, where he
would come to them next morning. Accordingly, two of their
number were detailed to take a view of their intended habitation,
who, coming to the place, found it to be very fast.</p>

<p>And here it must be observed that that wonderful providence
which always prevented his royal highness's difficulties
seemed in a particular instance remarkable here. He and his
faithful few, as has been observed above, running entirely out
of all manner of subsistence and being at a loss to know which
[<em>fol.</em> 633.]
way to be provided, they were immediately supplied by the
small detachment, they having shot the finest deer (a large
hart) that could be, at the very place where the Prince intended
to pass the night.</p>

<p>The two returning with their approbation of the place to
his royal highness, he (after permitting Major MacDonald of
Glenaladale to acquaint D. MacDonald of Lochgary of their
arrival at that place, and to send for him) set out for the
intended quarters with his party, and coming to the place,
they were most deliciously feasted with their late purchase.
Lochgary joined them that night, after which they took their
rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21 Aug.</div>

<p>About ten o'clock in the morning of August 21st, Cluns
Cameron joined them, and, remaining there till towards the
afternoon, Cluns conducted them into a wood at the foot of
Lochharkaig, where they lodged all night, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22 Aug.</div>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 634.]
Timeous in the morning of August 22d, an express was sent
off to Lochiel<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> to command his attendance. His royal highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
stayed in the foresaid place three days, till the return of
the express, who brought word that Lochiel, not being recovered
of his wounds and being at too great a distance, could not come,
but he sent his brother, Dr. Cameron, to make his apology, who
came to his royal highness upon August 25th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26 Aug.</div>

<p>August 26th. The Prince set out with his attendants, and
travelling about a mile came to a wood opposite to Achnacary
called Torramhuilt or Torvauilt. Dr. Cameron and Lochgary
having parted with his royal highness about three or four
o'clock in the afternoon to avoid suspicion, as did also Cluns
Cameron, how soon he had conducted his royal highness into
[<em>fol.</em> 365.]
this last habitation. In this place the Prince remained for eight
days, during which time the forementioned French gentlemen
were sent for and were brought to the place where his royal
highness was, and after staying two or three days with him,
were sent to a safe place to be taken due care of till such time
as they could get a passage to their own country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept.</div>

<p>The Prince seeing himself in a manner out of danger, having
got intelligence that all the forces which had been encamped
at Fort Augustus were dispersed up and down the kingdom,
and that no more was left there but Loudon's regiment; and
besides that all the militia were returned home, having delivered
back their arms; and supposing that a chance party might
come near the place where he was still, he had a safe retreat,
south and north as would be thought most convenient; upon
all these considerations put together he thought proper to
[<em>fol.</em> 636.]
dismiss Major Macdonald of Glenaladale home to his own
country near the coast, there to look out for the arrival of
French vessels which his royal highness expected daily for conveying
him safely off, and to bring him intelligence upon their
arrival, the Prince himself being resolved to remain in the same
place (unless he was surprized) to wait that event.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3 Sept.</div>

<p>Accordingly upon September 3d the Major set out, leaving
his royal highness attended by Lochgary and Cluns Cameron,
and arrived in his own country upon the 5th, where he remained
till the 13th, when Captain Sheridan and Lieutenant O'Burn
landed from on board two French ships that anchored in Lochnannuagh
upon the Arisaig side in order to carry off his royal
highness, they coming to the place where Glenaladale then was
and expecting to find the Prince with him.</p>

<p>Lochnannuagh is the boundary between Arisaig and Moydart,
[<em>fol.</em> 637.]
so that people can arrive upon either of these places out of
that loch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13 Sept.</div>

<p>Glenaladale set out that very night (September 13th) to
acquaint the Prince of the arrival of these ships and to conduct
him safely on board. But coming to the place where he expected
to have found him, to his great disappointment he could get
no person that could give any certain account whereabouts his
royal highness might happen to be. The Prince had been
obliged to retreat by a party that had come out of Fort Augustus
under the command of Culcairn and Captain Grant; and
Cluns Cameron, who had been appointed to acquaint the Major
where the Prince was to be found in case he should be obliged
to retreat, having gone out of the way without leaving any
directions for the Major either about his royal highness or
[<em>fol.</em> 638.]
himself, these things put the Major in the utmost pain, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the many disappointments and inconveniencies this
piece of inadvertency in Cluns might be the occasion of. Whilst
he was taken up with these melancholy thoughts, a poor woman
came accidentally where he was and told him the place where
Cluns was to be found. Immediately he set out with all diligence
and arrived at a shealling whither Cluns came soon after,
with whom he concerted measures for sending an express to his
royal highness, who by this time had gone where Lochiel was
for the reasons abovementioned, that so he might be speedily
informed about the arrival of the ships. When the concert
[<em>fol.</em> 639.]
about sending an express was adjusted, the Major returned
with all possible expedition to the ships to inform the gentlemen
of the reasons of the delay, and that the Prince would be
with them as quickly as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28 Sept.</div>

<p>As soon as his royal highness was informed that the vessels
were at Lochnannuagh he set out with all possible diligence for
that place, where he arrived about the 28th of September,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
accompanied by Lochgarry, John Roy Stewart, and Lochiel,
and went on board the <em>Happy</em>, a privateer of St. Malo's, which
set sail instantly upon his royal highness's being on board.</p>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;When Captain Alexander Macdonald was in my room
(Tuesday, December 29th) I read to him those passages in
[<em>fol.</em> 640.]
Mr. Æneas Macdonald's Journal which relate to the landing and
the marching down the country, and upon which he gave me
his observations. I took them down in writing from his own
mouth, and they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">July
1745</div>

<p>Vol. 3, page 509, 514. It is an oversight either in Mr.
Æneas Macdonald or in Dr. Burton not to have mentioned
that the Prince actually landed in Lochnannuagh upon the
Arisaig side,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and went to Boradale, which was the first roof he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
was under upon the continent of Scotland, Boradale is in
Arisaig. The landing at Lochshiel must be a mistake, as no
ship can land there, seeing it is only a fresh water loch. This
will be better cleared up in the following paragraph.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug.</div>

<p>Vol. 3, page 515. Before the Prince marched to Glenfinnan
he was at Glenaladale where old Glenbuicket joined him and
delivered over to him Captain Switenham (an English gentleman),
[<em>fol.</em> 641.]
one of the prisoners taken by Major Macdonell of Tiendrish.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
The foresaid Captain went to London upon his parole and
strictly kept it till the time prefixed was expired. At Glenfinnan
the Laird of Moror, of Clanranald's family, came up to the
Prince (before the standard was set up) with 150 men who
were joined to the fifty men of Clanranald's following, that had
been for some time keeping guard upon his royal highness, the
Prince himself thinking fifty men sufficient for that purpose,
the rest of Clanranald's men having been employed in carrying
the baggage and luggage from the head of Lochshiel<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> (up which
loch they had been brought in small boats) to the head of the
Loch-iel; which service kept the most of Clanranald's men back
for four days from joining the main body at Moidh or Moy
in Lochabar.</p>

<p>Captain Alexander MacDonald was on board the frigate in
[<em>fol.</em> 642.]
Lochnannuagh before the Prince set his foot on the continent,
but he acknowledges he did not then know that the Prince was
among the passengers, who being in a very plain dress, Captain
MacDonald made up to him without any manner of ceremony
and conversed with him in a very familiar way, sitting close
by the Prince and drinking a glass with him, till one of the
name of MacDonald made him such a look that immediately he
began to suspect he was using too much freedom with one above
his own rank. Upon this he soon withdrew, but still was in
the dark as to what particular person the young gentleman he
had been conversing with might be.</p>

<p>Vol. 3, page 519. Captain MacDonald declared that he could
not help looking upon the affair of O'Sullivan's hiding himself
in a barn, etc., as a romance.</p>

<p>At the same time I read in the hearing of Captain Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 643.]
MacDonald the passages in the Journal of Duncan Cameron,
etc., that relate to the landing and the marching down the
country. He owned they were very exact, and he made only
two short remarks upon them, which are as follows.</p>

<p>Vol. 2, page 356. Captain MacDonald said it was most
certain that if Keppoch, Lochiel, and young Clanranald had not
joined the Prince, he would have been forced to shift for himself
in the best manner he could.</p>

<p>Vol. 2, page 359. A night at Dalquhinnie before marching
to Dalnacardoch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June</div>

<p>I then read in the hearing of Captain Alexander MacDonald
the conclusion of Captain O'Neille's own subscription, which had
been lying by me for some time till I should find leisure to take
[<em>fol.</em> 644.]
an exact transcript of it.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> In the forementioned conclusion Captain
O'Neille complains of one in Benbecula that had betrayed
him even after he had entirely confided in him, but he does not
name the person. I asked at Captain MacDonald if he could
inform me who that person was. He told me he knew the
whole affair well, and that he would give it me faithfully and
honestly. He said that Ranald MacDonald of Torulum in
Benbecula was the man there meant,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and that the whole story
had taken its rise altogether from a jealousy in Captain O'Neille.
Ranald MacDonald happened unluckily to have an outcast with
Captain O'Neille, who, though a very clever fellow, was heartily
threshed by a MacDonald, they having had a boxing bout
together. This unlucky difference made O'Neille strongly
believe, when he happened to be seized, that Ranald MacDonald
had actually betrayed him, whereas Ranald refused to betray
[<em>fol.</em> 645.]
him when a sum of money was offered him for that purpose.
Upon this Ranald MacDonald has given his oath of old Clanranald,
who questioned him upon the report of his having betrayed
O'Neille, and was very hard upon him for it, swearing
that he deserved to be shot through the head if he had done
any such dishonourable thing.</p>

<p>As to the story of General Campbell and Campbell of Skipness,
Captain MacDonald declared to me he did not in the least
doubt the truth of that, for this single reason, because all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Campbells, from the head to the foot of them, had discovered a
most avaritious, greedy temper in the matter of pillaging and
plundering their native country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29 Dec.</div>

<p>Captain Alexander MacDonald spoke excellent things of
Donald MacLeod of Gualtergill in Sky, and saying that he did
not know an honester man or a stauncher loyalist.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> He told
[<em>fol.</em> 646.]
me that Donald MacLeod's wife is aunt to the present
Glenaladale.</p>

<p>Captain MacDonald had all his effects plundered and pillaged.
After everything was destroyed or carried off, the party
happening to spy a living cat, immediately killed poor harmless
puss, and threw it out of the way, lest the poor mother and her
children should have eaten the dead cat in their necessity. For
Cumberland and his army were exceedingly desirous that the
young and old (women and infants not excepted) they did not
murder might be starved to death, which was the fate of too
many, and their endeavours were fully equal to their desires.</p>

<p>Captain MacDonald and his wife and children wandered
through hills and mountains till the act of indemnity appeared,
and in the time of their skulking from place to place his poor
wife fell with child, which proved to be a daughter, and is still
alive. He is a very smart, acute man, remarkably well skilled in
[<em>fol.</em> 647.]
the Erse, for he can both read and write the Irish language in its
original character, a piece of knowledge almost quite lost in the
Highlands of Scotland, there being exceedingly few that have
any skill at all in that way. For the Captain told me that he
did not know another person (Old Clanranald only excepted)
that knew anything of the first tongue in its original character;
but that the natives of Ireland (particularly in the higher parts
of the country) do still retain the knowledge of it. Several of
the Captain's acquaintances have informed me that he is by far
the best Erse poet in all Scotland, and that he has written many
songs in the pure Irish.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 648.] In order to judge of the state of the Prince's affairs at the
time of the battle of Culloden, it will not be amiss to look back
to the time of his coming to Inverness, where the Earl of Loudon
commanded before his highness's coming there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16 Feb.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Feb.</div>

<p>The Earl of Loudon hearing of the Prince's coming, and
that he was to quarter that night at Moy<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> (the seat of the
Laird of Mackintosh, about seven miles from Inverness), formed
a design to surprize him and to carry him off, as he was to have
but a few men with him for his guard. The Earl marched
from Inverness with most of the garrison, and was within about
two miles of Moy, where accidentally five of the Prince's people<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
[<em>fol.</em> 649.]
going about their own private affairs met with Loudon's
advanced guard, and being under night called to them. But
the five, finding who they were, called out loudly for Lochiel and
the other clans to advance. Lord Loudon's people, not doubting
but they were there, took flight and returned to Inverness
in great confusion, and left it next day on the Prince's appearing
on the rising ground above the town, returning with his men
to the shire of Ross, where they continued till the Earl of
Cromarty with a party was sent in pursuit of them.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Upon his
approach they retired towards Tain, where we shall leave them
for a while and return to Inverness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17 Feb.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Feb.</div>

<p>The Prince coming before the place, summoned the castle to
surrender, and on being refused a battery was raised; but the
canon being but small, had little effect upon it, which obliged
[<em>fol.</em> 650.]
the besiegers to have recourse to a sap, which being brought
near the angle of one of the bastions, the castle was surrendered
and the garrison made prisoners. This being done, Brigadier
Stapleton, with Lochiel's and Keppoch's regiments, Lord John
Drummond's (which was not compleat, a great many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
being made prisoners in their passage to Scotland), and the
French piquets, were sent to besiege Fort Augustus, which surrendered
likewise, and the garrison were made prisoners. After
which it was thought proper to leave part of Lord John Drummond's
regiment there, and to send Lochiel's and Keppoch's
regiments, the French piquets and some of Lord John Drummond's
regiment (in all not 300 men) with Brigadier Stapleton
to invest Fort William, where we shall leave them and return
to the Earl of Cromarty in pursuit of the Earl of Loudon
towards Tain, where the said Earl crossed the ferry with his
[<em>fol.</em> 651.]
men and went over to the shire of Sutherland; where we shall
again leave him for a while and return to Inverness, from which
the most of the Prince's troops that were not employed as above
were sent to Speyside, under the command of Lord John Drummond,
to guard that river against any surprize from the Duke
of Cumberland, who by that time was come with his troop to
Aberdeen, and had sent some of Kingston's horse and some of
the Argyleshire men to Keith<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> (a small village about six miles
from the river Spey), where they were all surprized and made
prisoners.</p>

<p>As it had been assured that the Duke of Cumberland was
to stay at Aberdeen (where he had thrown up some works to
prevent a surprize) till all the forces he expected should join
him, the Prince on his part took his measures, and in order to
secure a retreat in case he had no mind to fight till he should
get all his men together, or to march into Perthshire if needful
[<em>fol.</em> 652.]
for the better support of his army, was advised to endeavour
the recovery of Blair Castle (which he would not allow to be
burnt when he passed that way), which was then possessed by
Sir Andrew Agnew with some regular troops under his command,
as were most of the principal posts in Athol by the
Campbells; whilst the 6000 Hessians and St. George's dragoons
lay at Crief and places adjacent. Lord George Murray was
ordered to march with the Athol men to Badenoch to join the
MacPhersons that lay about Ruthven of Badenoch (from the
time the Prince had passed that way) to guard the passes leading
to and from Athol and to get intelligence on that side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">March</div>

<p>As soon as Lord George had joined the MacPhersons they
marched with such expedition into Athol that they surprized
a great many of the Campbells at Blairfetty, Keinochin, and
other posts possessed by them, and made most of them prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
[<i>fol.</i> 653.]
Sir Andrew Agnew,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> being alarmed by his out-sentinels, retired
into the castle, in which he was shut up for seventeen days, some
part of which time it was battered with two pieces of canon,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
one of three, the other of four pounds, which made but little
impression upon the walls, though they ruined the roof.</p>

<p>During this time the Hessians marched to relieve the castle,
and some of the Athol men being advanced as far down as
Dunkeld to get intelligence and to guard that with other passes
on the river, where were frequent skirmishes between them and
the Hessian hussars, and some of St. George's dragoons who
had come to reconnoitre some days before the foot came up.
But when they were come up, the Athol men were obliged to
retire (as they could not be supported at such a distance) to
Pitlochrie, near the famous pass of Killicrankie, where, with some
others that were sent from Blair, they continued about eight
[<em>fol.</em> 654.]
days (the MacPhersons with some of the Athol men keeping
Sir Andrew and his men still shut up in the Castle), always
skirmishing with the hussars and dragoons till their foot came
up, which obliged the Athol men to retire into the above pass,
where they continued that day. But as they were few in number,
Lord George called a council of the officers, who were of opinion
that the pass was not tenable, since it might be surrounded on
all sides by such a vastly superiour number. It was therefore
resolved to abandon both it and the Castle, which was accordingly
done that night. And having sent the canon away, they
marched to Ruthven of Badenoch without the least interruption
from the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Here the MacPhersons were left as formerly,
and the Athol men were ordered to the Speyside. Lord George
went on to Inverness, and upon his arrival there, intelligence
being brought that Lord Loudon had repass'd with his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
from Sutherland to Tain, he was ordered to march with some
[<i>fol.</i> 655.]
troops to join the Earl of Cromarty and to give Lord Loudon
battle if he would stay for it. But he, hearing of Lord George's
march, returned to Sutherland again. Lord George, having
given the necessary orders to Lord Cromarty (who continued to
command in that country), returned to Inverness, where it was
resolved the Duke of Perth should be sent to take upon him
the command,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and if possible to get as many boats together as
would ferry over his men, and to drive Lord Loudon out of
Sutherland if he would not stay to fight. The boats were got
together, and the Duke of Perth with his men passed over
without being perceived and surprized Lord Loudon's people,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
obliged them to capitulate, and made them prisoners. Lord
Loudon and the President of the Session of Scotland made
their escape. After which the Duke of Perth seized some ships
that lay in the Firth of Tain, on board of which were all the
valuable effects that were shipt on board at Inverness before
Lord Loudon left it, the military chest excepted, which had
[<em>fol.</em> 656.]
been conveyed on board a frigate which lay in the bay. This
done, the Duke of Perth returned to Inverness, leaving the command
to the Earl of Cromarty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April</div>

<p>About this time, the <em>Hazard</em> sloop returning from France
with money, arms, and ammunition, and several French and
Spanish officers on board, was chased on shore by an English
man of war in Lord Rae's country,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> where they landed their
cargo, and, apprehending no danger from the country people,
they provided themselves with a guide to conduct them and
their cargo to the Earl of Cromarty. But as they were on
their march they were set upon by Lord Rae's people, who,
after a good resistance, made them prisoners and carried off the
cargo, which was thought could not have been done without
the treachery of the guide, who disappeared before the action
began. The news being brought to Inverness, orders were sent
to the Earl of Cromarty to send a party into Lord Rae's
country to demand satisfaction. But his Lordship, being somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
[<em>fol.</em> 657.]
dilatory in executing his orders, Lord Rae's people gathered
together with some of Lord Loudon's officers at their head.</p>

<p>About this time advice was brought to Inverness that the
Duke of Cumberland (being joined by all the forces he expected)
had begun his march from Aberdeen northwards, and had
ordered the ships that attended him with provisions for his
army to coast along in sight of him to Inverness. Upon which,
orders were dispatched to the Earl of Cromarty to call in all
his detachments, and to march with all expedition to join the
Prince.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> He gave his orders accordingly, and went himself with
some of his officers to Dunrobin Castle to bid adieu to the
Countess of Sutherland, and to thank her for the civilities they
had received from her. Whilst they were there amusing themselves,
the castle was surrounded by Lord Sutherland's and Lord
Rae's people, who, having had intelligence of their being there,
[<em>fol.</em> 658.]
made them all prisoners. Orders were likewise sent at this
time to the MacPhersons, and to those that were at Fort
Augustus and Fort William, to join the Prince as soon as possible.
Those from Fort Augustus and the French piquets
joined on Saturday, and Lochiel from Fort William on Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
Advice was brought on Monday that the Duke of Cumberland
was coming to the Spey, and that Lord John Drummond, with
the troops under his command, was retiring. Upon which the
Prince ordered the drums to beat and the pipes to play to arms.
The men in the town assembled as fast as they could, the canon
was ordered to march, and the Prince mounted on horseback
and went out at their head to Culloden House, the place of
rendezvous; and Lord George Murray was left in the town to
bring up those that were quartered in the neighbourhood of
Inverness, which made it pretty late before he joined the Prince
at Culloden. Orders were likewise sent to Lord John Drummond
[<em>fol.</em> 659.]
to assemble there likewise, which he did the next day,
being Tuesday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">15 April</div>

<p>Tuesday,<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> being April 15th, the whole army marched up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the muir, about a mile to the eastward of Culloden House,
where they were all drawn up in order of battle to wait the
Duke of Cumberland's coming. Keppoch's men joined in the
field from Fort William, and the whole was reviewed by the
Prince, who was very well pleased to see them in such good
spirits, tho' they had eaten nothing that day but one single
bisket a man, provisions being very scarce, and money too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16 April</div>

<p>The Prince (being informed that the Duke of Cumberland
had halted that day at Nairn to refresh his men, and that the
ships with his provisions were coming into the bay of Inverness
that evening) called a council of war, and, after great debates
[<em>fol.</em> 660.]
(although neither the Earl of Cromarty&mdash;who by that time was
prisoner, tho' not known&mdash;nor the MacPhersons, nor a great
many of the Frasers, were come up) it was resolved to march
and endeavour to surprize the Duke in his camp at Nairn, about
twelve miles distant. Accordingly, the march was begun between
seven and eight o'clock at night, the first column commanded
by Lord George Murray, the second by the Prince.
The night being dark occasioned several halts to be made for
bringing up the rear. When about half way, Lord George
ordered Colonel Ker, one of the Prince's aid-de-camps, to go
from front to rear and give orders to the respective officers to
order the men to make the attack sword in hand,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> which was
thought better, as it would not alarm the enemy soon, and that
their fire-arms would be of use to them afterwards. When he
[<em>fol.</em> 661.]
returned to the front to acquaint Lord George Murray of his
having executed his orders, he found they were halted a little
to the eastward of Kilravock House, deliberating whether or
not they should proceed (having then but four miles to march
to Nairn, where the enemy was encamped) or return to Culloden,
as they had not an hour at most, or thereabout, to daylight;
and if they could not be there before that time the
surprize would be rendered impracticable, and the more so as it
was not to be doubted that the enemy would be under arms
before daylight, as they were to march that morning to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the Prince battle. The Duke of Perth and his brother, Lord
John, who had been sent to advise the Prince, returned to Lord
George.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Lochiel and others, who were in the front, hearing
that there was a great interval between the two lines, which
would take up most of the time to daylight to join, it was
resolved to return to Culloden, which was accordingly done;
[<em>fol.</em> 662.]
which, some say, was contrary to the Prince's inclinations. They
marched the shortest way back by the church of Croy, which,
though but scarce two miles from the place where the halt was
made, yet it was clear daylight before the front arrived there,
which makes it clear there was no possibility of surprizing the
enemy before daylight, as was designed.</p>

<p>The march was continued to Culloden, from whence a great
many, both officers and soldiers, went to Inverness and other
places in quest of provisions, which were very much wanted.
The Prince, with great difficulty having got some bread and
whiskie at Culloden, where, reposing himself a little after having
marched all that night on foot, had intelligence brought that
the enemy was in sight, whereupon those about Culloden were
ordered to arms, and several officers sent to Inverness and
places adjacent to bring up what men they could meet with.</p>

<p>Whilst those about Culloden were marching up to the muir
[<em>fol.</em> 663.]
above the house, where they were join'd by about three hundred
of the Frasers just then come up, Colonel Ker went out to
reconnoitre the enemy. When he returned, he told the Prince
and Lord George that their foot were marching up in three
columns with their cavalry on their left, so that they could form
their line of battle in an instant. The Prince ordered his men
to be drawn up in two lines, and the few horse he had in the
rear towards the wings, and the canon to be disperst in the
front, which were brought up with great difficulty for want of
horses.</p>

<p>As there was not time to march to the ground they were on
the day before, they were drawn up a mile farther westward,
with a stone inclosure on the right of the first line, and the
second at a proper distance behind; after having reconnoitred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the inclosure, which ran down to the Water of Nairn<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> on the
right, so that no body of men could pass without throwing
[<em>fol.</em> 664.]
down the wall. And to guard further against any attempts
that might be made on that side, there were two battalions
placed facing outwards, which covered the right of the two lines,
and to observe the motion of the enemy, if they should make
any attempt that way.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland formed his line at a great distance,
and marched in battle-order till he came within canon shot,
where he halted and placed his canon in different places, at
some distance in his front, which outwinged the Prince's both
to the right and left without his cavalry, which were mostly
on the left, some few excepted that were sent to cover the right.
As soon as the Duke's canon were placed, he began canonading,
which was answered by the Prince's, who rode along the lines
to encourage his men, and posted himself in the most convenient
place (here one of his servants was killed by his side) to see
[<em>fol.</em> 665.]
what pass'd, not doubting but the Duke would begin the attack,
as he had both the wind and weather on his back, snow and
hail falling very thick at the same time.</p>

<p>Here it is to be observed that neither those that had been
with the Earl of Cromarty (he, with his son and some of his
officers being only made prisoners, his men having marched on
before), nor the MacPhersons, nor between two and three
thousand men that had been on the field the day before, were
come up. Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, and the
Duke's canon playing with great execution,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Lord George
Murray, who commanded the right,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> sent Colonel Ker to the
Prince to know if he should begin the attack, which the Prince
accordingly ordered. As the right was farther advanced than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the left, Colonel Ker went to the left and ordered the Duke of
Perth, who commanded there, to begin the attack, and rode
[<em>fol.</em> 666.]
along the line till he came to the right, where Lord George was,
who attacked at the head of the Athol men (who had the right
of the army that day) with all the bravery imaginable, as did
indeed the whole line, breaking the Duke's line in several
places, and making themselves masters of two pieces of the
enemy's canon. Though they were both fronted and flanked
by them, they, notwithstanding, marched up under a close firing
from right to left to the very points of their bayonets, which
they could not see for the smoak till they were upon them.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the attack the Campbells<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> threw down
a great deal of the wall of the inclosure for the dragoons on the
Duke's left to pass to the rear of the Prince's army, which they
were suffered to do without receiving one shot from the two
battalions that were placed to observe their motions. This
being observed, and the constant fire kept up by the Duke's
foot in the front, put the Prince's people in disorder and
[<em>fol.</em> 667.]
rendered the defeat of his army compleat.</p>

<p>The Prince retired in good order with some few of his men,
and crossed the Water of Nairn at the ford on the highway
between Inverness and Corryburgh, without being pursued by
the enemy, where he parted with them, taking only a few of
FitzJames's horse and some gentlemen along with him up that
river, the rest taking the highway to Ruthven of Badenoch,
where they stayed some days expecting an answer to a letter
that was sent to the Prince; but it not coming in the time
expected, they all separated, every one to do the best he could
for himself. Most of the clans had gone from the field of battle
towards their respective countries.</p>

<p>The publick has been no ways favourable to Lord George
Murray,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> but if they had been witnesses of his zeal and activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
from the time he joined in that affair to the last of it, his
exposing his person wherever an occasion offered, and in particular
[<em>fol.</em> 668.]
at the battle of Culloden, where he went on with the
first and came not off till the last, they would have done him
more justice. And whatever sentiments they have been pleased
to say the Prince had of him, they are hardly to be credited,
and for this reason; because when, after the battle, Colonel Ker
went to acquaint the Prince how affairs were going, his highness
enquired particularly about Lord George Murray, and,
being told that he had been thrown from his horse in the time
of the action, but was no way hurt, the Prince, in presence of
all that were there, desired Colonel Ker to find him out and
[<em>fol.</em> 669.]
take particular care of him, which it is to be presumed he would
not have done if he had had the least suspicion of what has
been laid to <em>his charge by his enemies</em>.</p>

(see <cite>Scots Magazine</cite> for said year, page 238), and was found
guilty, November 6th, 1746 (see <cite>Scots Magazine</cite> for said year,

is under a reprieve, and continues still to be a prisoner in a

who did much good in that way.</p>

<p>[<em>fol.</em> 670.] Having heard and seen many scandalous libels given out in

15 April</div>

<div class="sidenote">16 April</div>

<p>April 15th, O.S.&mdash;Prince Charles marched his army in three
columns from Culloden Muir in hopes to surprize the Duke of
Cumberland in his camp at Nairn, ordering at the same time
two thousand men to pass the river Nairn and post themselves
between Elgin and the camp of the enemy. To deceive the
ships that were in Inverness Road he ordered several fires to
be made on the mountain where he drew up in battle. At
eight at night he began his march, and about two next morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
being the 16th of April, within a mile<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> of the enemy, our
van halted. The Prince, who marched in the centre, dispatched
an aid-de-camp to know the motive of the halt. Colonel<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
[<em>fol.</em> 672.]
O'Sullivan (who marched in the van) immediately hasted to
the Prince and told him Lord George Murray and some other
of the chieftains, as they wanted some of their men, did not
think themselves sufficiently strong to attack the enemy, and
upon a strong belief the Duke of Cumberland was apprized of
their design, refused to advance, maugre the instances he
(Colonel O'Sullivan) made use of to engage them to the contrary.
Upon this the Prince advanced to the head of the column,
where, assembling the chiefs, in the most pathetic and strong
terms demonstrated to them the visible and real advantages
they had of an enemy who thought themselves secure of any
such attempt, and descending his horse,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> drew his sword, and
told them he would lead them to an enemy they had as often
defeated as seen. But, deaf to his example and intreaties, the
[<em>fol.</em> 673.]
major part declin'd, which so sensibly shocked the Prince, that,
remounting his horse, he told them with the greatest concern<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
he did not so much regret his own loss as their inevitable ruin.
He immediately marched back to the former camp at Culloden,
where he arrived at five in the morning. At ten he was informed
the Duke of Cumberland was in full march towards
him. Whereupon the Prince gave the necessary orders for the
attack, riding from rank to rank encouraging his troops and
exhorting them [with his usual sprightliness]<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> to behave as they
had done at Prestonpans and Falkirk. Between twelve and
one the Prince engag'd the enemy, commanding himself in the
centre. The right wing immediately broke the left of the
enemy, but their flank being exposed to seven<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> squadrons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
horse, who attack'd them while they were in pursuit of the
[<em>fol.</em> 674.]
enemy's foot, was put into so much confusion that it was dispers'd.
The Prince gallop'd to the right, and endeavouring to
rally them<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> had his horse shot under him.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The left followed
the example of the right, which drew on an entire deroute in
spite of all the Prince could do to animate or rally them.
Notwithstanding which he remained upon the field of battle
untill there were no more hopes left, and then could scarce be
persuaded to retire, ordering the Irish piquets and FitzJames's
horse to make a stand and favour the retreat of the Highlanders,
which was as gallantly executed. Previous to the
battle the Prince had ordered the chieftains that (in case of a
defeat) as the Highlanders could not retreat as regular troops,
they should assemble their men near Fort Augustus. In consequence
of this, immediately after the battle the Prince dispatched
me to Inverness to repeat his orders to such of his
[<em>fol.</em> 675.]
troops as were there. That night the Prince retir'd six miles
from the field of battle<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and went next day as far, and in three
days more arrived at Fort Augustus, where he remained a
whole day in expectation his troops would have join'd him.
But seeing no appearance of it, he went to the house of Invergary
and ordered me to remain there to direct such as pass'd
that way the road he took. I remained there two days and
announc'd the Prince's orders to such as I met, but to no effect,
every one taking his own road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28 April</div>

<p>I then followed the Prince, who was so far from making a
precipitate retreat [as has been maliciously reported]<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> that he
retired by six and six miles and arrived the 28th of April<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> O.S.
at Knoidart, where I join'd him next day and gave him an
[<em>fol.</em> 676.]
account of the little or no appearance there was of assembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
his troops, upon which he wrote circular letters to all the
chiftains, enjoining them, by the obedience they owed him, to
join him immediately with such of their clans as they could
gather; at the same time representing to them the imminent
danger they were in if they neglected it. After remaining
some days there in hopes his orders would have been obeyed,
and seeing not one person repair to him, the extreme danger
his person was in, being within seven miles<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> of Lord Loudon,
Sir Alexander MacDonald and the MacLeods, it was proposed
to evade it by retreating to one of the islands near
the continent. After repeated instances of the like nature he
reluctantly assented, leaving Mr. John Hay behind to transmit
[<em>fol.</em> 677.]
him the answers of his letters, with an account of what should
pass, and parted for the Isles in an open fishing boat at eight
at night, attended by Colonel O'Sullivan and me only.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> About
an hour after we parted a violent hurricane arose, which drove us
ninety miles<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> from our designed port; and next day running for
shelter into the Island of North Uist,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> we struck upon a rock
and staved to pieces,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and with great difficulty saved our lives.
At our landing we were in the most melancholy situation,
knowing nobody and wanting the common necessaries of life.
After much search we found a little hut uninhabited, and
took shelter there, and with a great deal of pains made a fire
to dry our cloaths. Here the Prince remained two days,
[<em>fol.</em> 678.]
having no other provisions but a few biskets we had saved out
of the boat, which were entirely spoiled with the salt water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1 May.</div>

<div class="sidenote">6 May</div>

<p>As this island belonged to Sir Alexander MacDonald, and
not judging ourselves safe, we determined going elsewhere, and
by the greatest good fortune, one of our boatmen discovered
a boat<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> stranded on the coast, and, having with great difficulty
launched it into the water, we imbarked for the Harris. In
our passage we unfortunately met with another storm which
obliged us to put into an island near Stornoway. Next day
the Prince dispatched me<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> for Stornoway to look for a ship,
ordering me to imbark on board the first I could get, and to
make the most diligent haste after my landing on the Continent
to the Court of France, ordering me to give an exact account to
[<em>fol.</em> 679.]
his most Christian Majesty of his disasters and of his resolution
never to abandon the country untill he knew the final result of
France, and if it was not<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> possible once more to assemble his
faithful Highlanders. Unluckily the person that the Prince
sent with me<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> getting drunk, told the master of the ship somewhat
that induced him to refuse taking me on board, and
immediately alarmed the country, which obliged me to return
and join the Prince, who upon what I told him resolved for
the continent by way of Seaforth's country. But the boatmen
absolutely refused to comply, which made us take the road we
came. And meeting with three ships of war we were constrained
[<em>fol.</em> 680.]
to put into a desert island where we remained eight
days<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> in the greatest misery, having no sustenance but some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
dried fish that Providence threw in our way in this island.
When the ships disappeared we put to sea again, and next
morning met with another ship of war just coming out of one
of the lochs, who pursued us for near an hour; but the wind
rising we made our escape. In the afternoon we arrived at
the Island of Benbecula, and one of the boatmen, being acquainted
with a herd of the island, led us to his house, where,
passing for friends of the boatman, we remained four days, and
then the Prince sent the boat to the continent with a Highland
gentleman whom he charged with letters to the chiefs, Secretary
[<em>fol.</em> 681.]
Murray and John Hay, requiring an exact account how affairs
stood.</p>

<p>Not thinking ourselves secure in the cottage, by the advice
of a friend we retired to the mountain of Coradale to wait the
return of the gentleman, where we remained two-and-twenty
days, when the gentleman returned with a letter from Secretary
Murray importing that the clans had almost all delivered up
their arms, and, consequently, were no more to be depended on.
He likewise acquainted the Prince of two French ships who
had arrived at the continent with money and arms, and in
which the Duke of Perth, his brother, Sir Thomas Sheridan,
and John Hay had imbarked for France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>Here we remained some days longer, till the Duke of
Cumberland having intelligence that the Prince was concealed
in the Long Isle, ordered the militia of the Isle of Sky and
the Independent Companies to go in search of him. As soon
[<em>fol.</em> 682.]
as we had notice of their landing we retreated to an island
about twelve miles distance, called Ouya, where we remained
till we found they had followed us, and then we went for Loch
Boisdale, and stayed there eight days, when Captain Carolina
Scott landed within a mile of us, which obliged us to separate,
the Prince taking me to the mountains, and O'Sullivan remaining
with the boatmen. At nightfall we marched towards
Benbecula, being informed Scott had ordered the militia to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
come and join him. At midnight we came to a hut, where by
good fortune we met with Miss Flora MacDonald, whom I
formerly knew. I quitted the Prince at some distance from
the hut, and went with a design to inform myself if the
Independent Companies were to pass that way next day, as we
had been informed. The young lady answered me&mdash;Not&mdash;and
said that they would not pass till the day after. Then I told
her I brought a friend to see her, and she, with some emotion,
[<em>fol.</em> 683.]
asked me if it was the Prince. I answered her it was, and
instantly brought him in.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> We then consulted on the imminent
danger the Prince was in, and could think of a no more proper
and safe expedient than to propose to Miss Flora to convey
him to the Isle of Sky, where her mother lived. This seemed
the more feasible, as the young lady's father being captain of
an Independent Company would accord her a pass for herself
and a servant to go visit her mother. The Prince assented,
and immediately propos'd it to the young lady, to which she
answered with the greatest respect and loyalty; but declined
it, saying Sir Alexander MacDonald was too much her friend
to be the instrument of his ruin. I endeavoured to obviate
this by assuring her Sir Alexander was not in the country,
and that she could with the greatest facility convey the Prince
to her mother's, as she lived close by the waterside. I then
[<em>fol.</em> 684.]
remonstrated to her the honour and immortality that would
redound to her by such a glorious action, and she at length
acquiesc'd, after the Prince had told her the sense he would
always retain of so conspicuous a service. She promised to
acquaint us next day when things were ripe for execution, and
we parted for the mountains of Coradale. Next day at four
in the afternoon we received a message from our protectress,
telling us <small>ALL WAS WELL</small>. We determined joining her immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
but the messenger informed us we could not pass
either of the fords that separated the island we were in from
Benbecula, as they were both guarded. In this dreadful situation
a man of the country tendered us his boat, which we
readily accepted, and next day landed at Benbecula, and
immediately marched for Rossinish, the place of rendezvous,
where we arrived at midnight, and instead of our protectress,
[<em>fol.</em> 685.]
found [ourselves within fifty yards of]<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> a guard of the enemy.
We were constrained to retreat four miles, having eat nothing
for thirty hours<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> before. The Prince ordered me to go to the
lady and know the reason she did not keep her appointment.
She told me she had engaged a cousin of hers in North Uist to
receive him in his house, where she was sure he would be more
safe than in the Isle of Sky.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> I immediately dispatched a boy
with this news to the Prince, and mentioned him the place of
appointment, whither he came. But the gentleman absolutely
refused receiving us, alleging for a motive that he was vassal
to Sir Alexander MacDonald. In this unexpected exigence,
being within a small half mile of a captain and fifty men,
we hastened for Rossinish, being apprized the enemy had just
[<em>fol.</em> 686.]
abandoned it. The Prince sent me to acquaint Miss Flora of
our disappointment and to intreat her to keep to her promise,
as there was no time to lose. She faithfully promised for next
day, and I remained with her that night, the Prince remaining
at Rossinish attended by a little herd. Next day I accompanied
Miss Flora to the rendezvous, where we had not long
been when we had an account<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> that General Campbell was
just landed with 1500 men.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> We were now apprehensive that
we were betrayed, and instantly got to our boat and put to
another place, where we arrived at daybreak. We dispatched
to Clanranald's house to learn what news, who brought us
word that General Campbell was there with Captain Ferguson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and that he saw Captain Scott's detachment coming to join
[<em>fol.</em> 687.]
them, and that they amounted in all to 2300 men. The
Prince intreated the young lady I should accompany him,
but she absolutely refused it, having a pass but for one
servant. The Prince was so generous as to decline going
unless I attended, untill I told him, if he made the least demur,
I would instantly go about my business, as I was extremely
indifferent what became of me so that his person was safe.
[With much difficulty and after many intreaties]<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> he at length
imbarked, attended only by Miss Flora MacDonald.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>Here my hard fate and the Prince's safety, which was my
only object, obliged me to share no longer the misfortunes of
that illustrious hero, whose grandeur of soul and intrepidity,
with a calmness of spirit particular to himself in such dangers,
[<em>fol.</em> 688.]
increased in these moments when the general part of mankind
abandon themselves to their fate. I now could only
recommend him to God and his good fortune, and made my
way amidst the enemy to South Uist, where we had left Colonel
O'Sullivan.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Next day I joined O'Sullivan, and found (four
days after the Prince parted) a French cutter, commanded by
one Dumont, and who had on board two captains of the Irish
brigade with a number of volunteers. Here Colonel O'Sullivan
and I concerted what were the properest measures to be taken.
We agreed that he should go on board the cutter, as he was so
reduced by the long fatigues that he had undergone in the
mountains, as not to be able to walk, and that he should
bring the cutter to Loch Seaforth, nigh the Isle of Rasay,
where the Prince ordered me to join him by a billet he had
sent me the day before by one of the boatmen who had rowed
[<em>fol.</em> 689.]
him to the Isle of Sky. After having seen my friend on board,
and after innumerable difficulties, I got a boat and went round
the Isle of Sky to the Isle of Rasay, place of rendezvous; but
at my landing had intelligence that the Prince was returned to
the Isle of Sky, whereupon I hasted to said Isle of Sky again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and there too had the grief to learn that he had departed
that island, but for what place nobody could inform me in
the least. I then repaired to Loch Nammaddy in North Uist,
where by our agreement Colonel O'Sullivan was to come to
me in case that in eight days I did not join him at Loch Scaforth;
but not meeting my friend there, after a delay of four
days I returned to the Island of Benbecula, where I promised
[<em>fol.</em> 690.]
myself greater safety than any where else; but I met with a quite
different usage. For the very person<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> in whom I had entirely
confided, and under whose care I was, betrayed me to Captain
MacNeal (induced thereto by a great sum of money offered for
me), who was in that country under the command of Captain
Ferguson of the <em>Furnace-Bomb</em>. I was taken by this Captain
MacNeal in a rock over a loch, where I had skulked for four days,
and brought to Captain Ferguson,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> who used me with all the barbarity
of a pirate, stripped me, and had ordered me to be put
into a rack and whipped by his hangman, because I would not
confess where I thought the Prince was. As I was just going
to be whipped, being already stripped, Lieutenant MacCaghan
of the Scotch Fusileers, who commanded a party under Captain
[<em>fol.</em> 691.]
Ferguson, very generously opposed this barbarous usage,
and coming out with his drawn sword threatened Captain
Ferguson that he'd sacrifice himself and his detachment rather
than to see an officer used after such an infamous manner.</p>

<p>I can't avoid acquainting the public that four days after I
was taken<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> General Campbell sent me word upon his parole of
honour that if I had money, or other effects in the country, in
sending them to him they should be safe. Upon which (always
imagining that the word of honour was as sacredly kept in the
English army as 'tis in others) I went with a detachment for
my money and gold watch which I had hid in the rock when I
perceived the party searching for me, and sent to General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Campbell by Captain Skipness Campbell 450 guineas, with my
gold watch, broadsword, and pistols, all which he has thought
[<em>fol.</em> 692.]
proper (to be sure consistent with his honour) to keep from me
upon diverse applications made to him to that purpose.</p>

<p>I hope the public will excuse this long digression, that I
have made since my separation from the Prince, the more so
that I have only made it to show that I did everything in my
power as well to fulfil my duty as to endeavour to deserve the
confidence with which the Prince was graciously pleased to
honour me.</p>

<p>A coppy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">1747
8 Dec.</div>

<p><em>N.B.</em>&mdash;After getting notice that Captain Felix O'Neille, after
his being removed from the Castle of Edinburgh to some part
in England, had transmitted an attested copy of his Journal to
one of his friends in Edinburgh, I was at no small pains to find
it out. At last I discovered that it was in the hands of the
Countess of Dundonald. Upon Tuesday, December 8th, 1747,
I did myself the honour of paying my respects to lady Mary
Cochran in Edinburgh. I begged to know of her ladyship if
[<em>fol.</em> 693.]
it was true that the Countess had any such Journal and if I
could have the favour of seeing it. Lady Mary said it was
very true that her mamma had the Journal with O'Neille's own
subscription at it, and that it was transmitted to her from
O'Neille himself, and that she would endeavour to procure
it for me from her mamma and send it down to me as soon as
possible. But, then, her ladyship was pleased to observe that
the Countess would not allow any copy to be taken of it, as
Captain O'Neille had desired that no copy should be given of
it, till he should send a letter to the Countess from France,
wherein he would give allowance for copies to be taken of it at
a proper time. And therefore Lady Mary added that all the
favour I could obtain was only the reading of it. To this I
answered that I had heard the Journal was made a great secret,
and seeing it was so, I did not chuse to have the trust of it;
for that if copies should happen to appear from other quarters
it might be said that I had taken a copy without any allowance,
[<em>fol.</em> 694.]
and thereby had become the occasion of spreading it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
therefore I would much rather chuse to read it in her ladyship's
presence and return it directly into her hands, if her ladyship
would take the trouble of procuring me a sight of it while I
had the honour of being with her. Lady Mary was so good
as to say that though my Lady Dundonald was confined
to her apartment with a severe cold, she would step to her and
ask a reading of the Journal. Accordingly, in a very short
time, Lady Mary returned and gave me the Journal. After
reading of it I could not help declaring my surprize that the
Journal should be made a matter of so much nicety when I
could assure her ladyship that I had been master of a copy of
it (the preface and conclusion only excepted) for about six
months past, and that several such copies as mine were in
Edinburgh and other places of Scotland. Lady Mary said that
certainly Captain O'Neille's touching so severely upon General
Campbell behoved to be the reason why he made his Journal
an affair of such secrecy. To this I answered that the reason
[<em>fol.</em> 695.]
was good so long as Captain O'Neille remained in any part of
Scotland or England, because the making such a particular the
subject of common conversation might have brought rough
enough treatment upon Captain O'Neille. But now that he
was safe in France, I could not help looking upon it as a point
of justice to make that particular part of the Journal known
to the world, that so General Campbell might have an
opportunity of vindicating himself, if there was any mistake in
the case, and that if the charge was a fact, the truth might be
fixed. Then I added that if my Lady Dundonald could be
prevailed upon to allow me the use of the attested copy to
compare it with my own, and to take transcripts of the preface
and conclusion, I would promise to give her ladyship in return
for that favour a copy of Ker of Gradyne's account; and withal
I said I should not give copies of the preface and conclusion or
have any hand in making them common. Lady Mary was so
good as to assure me that she would faithfully report <em>that</em> to
[<em>fol.</em> 696.]
my Lady Dundonald, and would employ her interest to procure
that favour for me upon the conditions I had mentioned. I
then took leave, and said I would do myself the honour of
waiting upon her ladyship some day next week.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17 Dec.</div>

<p>Upon Thursday, December 17th, I again made my court to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Lady Mary, who had most faithfully performed her promise,
and had procured what I so much desired. Upon receiving
the attested Journal at Lady Mary's hands, I repeated
the conditions and assured her ladyship I would observe
them.</p>

<p>I had been promised the use of Ker of Gradyne's account
from the right reverend Bishop Keith in the Canongate, who
at that time had the only copy of it in Scotland. Lady Mary
informed me that the Countess was very much surprized to
hear that I should have a copy of O'Neille's Journal, the
preface and conclusion excepted, for that her ladyship had
firmly believed that there was no such thing in all Scotland as
the copy of a single sentence of it. Upon this I informed
Lady Mary that Mr. William MacDougal, Wine merchant,
[<em>fol.</em> 697.]
was master of a transcript of O'Neille's attested Journal, which
he had got when taking a jaunt with his lady in England for
her health sometime in the month of September, from one of
the French officers then prisoners upon parole at Berwick, but
that Mr. MacDougal had given his promise not to communicate
it by giving a copy to any one whatsoever, even though O'Neille
had before that time set out for France, the officers that were
left behind being much afraid that they themselves might feel
the effects of resentment, should the animadversion upon
General Campbell be publickly known before they should be
exchanged and set free. Upon comparing the attested copy
with the one I had formerly transcribed [vol. i. f. 181] I found
no other difference betwixt them than what might proceed from
a multiplicity of copies and from the unskilfulness and inattention
of transcribers. And therefore at first I intended only to
remark the differences of the two copies and to take transcripts
of the preface and conclusion. But, upon second thoughts, I
[<em>fol.</em> 698.]
judged it more eligible to take an exact and faithful transcript
of the whole of the attested copy, that so I might have it all
as it had come from the hands of Captain O'Neille, who had
sent it to my Lady Dundonald wrapped up in a cover with two
seals upon it, and with an address in the following words
precisely:&mdash;</p>

<p>'To the right honble. the Countess of Dondanold, Edinburgh.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>The remarks I have made<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> still hold good even as to the
attested copy: for (to omit other particulars) considering the
long time that Captain O'Neille was with the Prince after the
battle of Culloden (about ten or eleven weeks), and the great
variety of difficulties and dangers they had to struggle with
during all that time, certainly the Captain behoved to have
much more to say than what he has given an account of in his
Journal, had he only been at the trouble of taking time and
leisure to recollect himself with that accuracy and exactness
[<em>fol.</em> 699.]
which the importance of the subject justly calls for. In such
an uncommon and interesting scene of life the minutest
occurrence that has the smallest tendency to illustrate the
character of the <em>suffering hero</em> should not be omitted. Let
this piece of history be cooly and impartially considered only
from April 16th to September 20th, and I dare venture to say
one will not find a parallel to it in any history whatsoever.
For a prince to be a-skulking five long months exposed to the
hardships of hunger and cold, thirst and nakedness, and surrounded
on all hands by a numerous army of blood-thirsty
men, both by sea and land, eagerly hunting after the price of
blood, and yet that they should miss the much coveted aim, is
an event of life far surpassing the power of words to paint.
In a word, I presume it may be asserted with great truth that
the Prince (all circumstances considered) could not have been
safe in any other place of the three kingdoms but in the Highlands
of Scotland. Let any one compare O'Neille's Journal
[<em>fol.</em> 700.]
with Donald MacLeod's,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and I am persuaded he will find the
Captain's account of things dull and wanting when put into
the balance with that of the old honest Palinurus, whose simple
unadorn'd sayings have a peculiar energy and beauty in them.</p>

<em>May 11th, 1746: Stonehive,<br />
80 miles this side Inverness.</em>
</p>

<p>To which we marched since that glorious 16th of April which
gave liberty to three kingdom. These rapacious villains thought to
have destroyed their prisoners, and by their orderly books, had
they got the better, we were to have been every soul of us cut
off, and not have had one prisoner, and for the Duke he was to
have been cut as small as herbs for the pot, thus they and their
books declare. But, God be praised, he wou'd not suffer such
inhumanity and such barbarous villains to thrive, and I pray
God our young hero is preserved to be a second deliverer to
church and state; he beeing the darling of mankind, for we had
certainly been starved had it not been his care to bring ovens and
bakers with him. I say, Down on your knees all England and,
after praise to God who gives victory, pray for the young British
hero, for had he been at Falkirk these brave Englishmen that are
now in their graves had not been lost, his presence doing more
than five thousand men; and every man stands an equal chance
for his life without partiality; which has not been the case for
these six months last past. Your news papers give you a tolerable
account, so I shall not, nor can I, give you a better within the
compass of a letter. Since the last I sent you we find kill'd
amongst the rebels no less than ten colonels, seven majors, fifteen
captains, and as to lieutenants and ensigns, a volume of them. I
leave you to guess at the number of rank and file that must fall.
In short, 'tis mine and every bodie's opinion no history can brag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
of so singular a victory and so few of our men lost, that we lost
but one man; 'tho I fear I shall lose my horse, he having at this
moment of writing a ball in his left buttock. 'Twas pritty near
Enoch that time, but, thank God, a miss is as good as a mile, as we
say in Gloustershire. And now we have the pleasure of a bed
and not hard duty; but for six weeks before the battle few of
Cobham's heroes (thank God, that is our caracter from the Duke
and the general officers, except General Hawley, who does not love
us because our regiment spoke truth about Falkirk job), I say for
six weeks before I had not my cloaths off once, and had it not
been for our dear Bill, we had all been starved, only for the good
loaves he order'd for the army, and some provisions that came by
shipping. But thank God, I am well and in good quarters for this
country, and I hope I shall live to see you once more. I have the
vanity to believe Cobham's will be welcome to England now; for
the regiment has always been in front upon all occasions where
hard and dangerous duty was to be done: from our first setting
off to Stonefild where the sneaking dogs stole away in the night,
at Clifton-Moor where we dismounted and fought on foot and the
Duke thanked us at the head of the regiment and so he has done
several times. I shou'd be glad to hear what the caracter of
Cobham's is in England. Direct for me at Stonehive or elce-where.
'Tis impossible for me to tell you what hard duty we have done
since we have been in the north, but had we done ten times more,
'tis what I shou'd think of with pleasure so as we serve our King
and country. We are all hearty that is left of us, and we thank
and praise God for our deliverance. We have not lost above one
troop and one hundred horses, which I think a miracle. As to
what you say about agents, you must think I tried long ago. But, in
short, the officers dont care how little cash they have about them
in these parts, especialy in war; for every time we thought of a
battle the officers' servants had all the regiment's cash, rings, and
watches. I sold my watch a little before Falkirk's battle, and the
dear lad that bought it was kill'd the first fire, so that he and all
he had fell to these inhumane dogs. He was my particular friend.
I hope all is now over. We are guarding the coast that Charles may
not get off. I pray God I had him in this room, and he the last of
the Stuart race; it wou'd be my glory to stab the villain to the
heart. Beside it wou'd look well in history for him to fall by the
hand of a Bradshaw. I dare say did the rankest Jacobite in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
England know the misery he has brought on the north of England,
he wou'd be sick of the name of Stuart; for I have a shocking
story of their villainy, which wou'd make even a papist tremble at
the reading of it. My humble service to all friends in general. I
pray God I had a flicth of your bacon, but am well, and we have
bread and brandy in plenty.&mdash;Yours,</p>

thereto as colleague to the Rev. Laurence Drummond (whom he mentions in
this letter) in or about 1738. When Prince Charles and his army passed through
Perth on his way south, Mr. Lyon joined himself to them, especially as the
most influential part of his congregation had gathered to the Prince's standard.
He was appointed chaplain of Lord Ogilvie's regiment. After his arrest he was
imprisoned at Montrose, and thereafter at Carlisle, where he was tried, and
sentenced to be executed. He accordingly suffered death at Penrith on 28th
October 1746. For further particulars about Mr. Lyon the reader may consult

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> See a letter to his father on the same occasion, f. 381 <em>infra</em>. According to
Bishop Forbes, Mr. Deacon was the son of Dr. Thomas Deacon, who, he adds,
(f. 40 <em>infra</em>), was a non-jurant bishop in Manchester. But another contemporary
authority describes him as the son of an eminent and wealthy doctor of medicine
in Manchester, and states that Thomas was educated at the university to qualify
him for the same professions.&mdash;'History of the Rebellion,' extracted from the
<cite>Scots' Magazine</cite>, 1755, pp. 294-301. The fact is that Dr. Deacon engaged in
both professions. Three of his sons joined the Prince. Thomas was appointed
a lieutenant in the Manchester Regiment, and so was his brother Robert, while
Charles, the youngest, aged about seventeen, was made an ensign. All were
taken at the surrender of Carlisle, and sent prisoners to London. Robert
became so ill on the way that he was left at Kendal, and died there. Charles
was reprieved, though he was taken to the place of execution under a military
guard to see his brother and others suffer. The head of Thomas Deacon, with
others, was sent to Manchester to be stuck up on the Exchange there. His
father was the first to come and gaze upon it, and saluting it, thanked God that
he had had a son who could die for his lawful prince. Dr. Deacon only survived
his son about six years, and the inscription on his tombstone is worthy of
note:&mdash;'Here lie interred the remains (which through mortality are at present
corrupt, but which shall one day surely be raised again to immortality and put
on incorruption) of Thomas Deacon, the greatest of sinners and most unworthy
of primitive bishops, who died 16th February 1753, in the 56th year of his age.&mdash;Axon's

father secured his pardon, and returning home he married Margaret, daughter of
Captain John Chalmers (or Chambers) of Gogar, in Midlothian, but by her had no
issue. An account of his trial and execution, with some notice of his life and
family, and a portrait of him at the time of his death, was published in

On the inside of the front board of volume 3d are adhibited&mdash;1. Piece of the
Prince's garter-ribbon. 2. Piece of red velvet, anent which on back of title-page
is as follows: (by Mr. Robert Chambers) The small piece of red velvet on
the inside of the board was part of the ornaments of the Prince's sword-hilt.
While on his march to England he rested on a bank at Faladam, near Blackshiels,
where the young ladies of Whitburgh, sisters to his adherent, Robert
Anderson, presented some refreshments to him and his men. On being requested
by one of these gentlewomen for some keepsake, he took out his pen-knife
and cut a portion of velvet and buff leather from the hill of his sword,
which he gave to her with his usual courtesy, and which is still (1836) preserved
at Whitburgh. The above piece was cut from the larger fragment, and presented
to me by Miss Anderson of Whitburgh.&mdash;R. C. 3. Piece of Bettie
Burk's gown, sent by Mrs. MacDonald of Kingsburgh, according to promise,
f. 152. 4. Piece of apron-string, received from Miss Flora MacDonald. R. F.
saw the apron on that occasion and had it on him. On the inside of the backboard
of volume 3d are 5. Pieces of tartan, explained as under: The above are pieces
of the outside and inside of that identical waistcoat which MacDonald of Kingsburgh
gave to the Prince, when he laid aside the women's cloaths at the edge
of a wood, f. 1434. The said waistcoat being too fine for a servant, the Prince
exchanged it with Malcolm MacLeod, f. 239. Malcolm MacLeod, after parting
with the Prince and finding himself in danger of being seized, did hide the waistcoat
in a clift of a rock, where (upon his returning home in the beginning of
September 1747) he found it all rotten to bits, except only as much as would
serve to cover little more than one's loof, and two buttons, all which he was
pleased to send to me, f. 472. The waistcoat had lain more than a full year in
the clift of the rock, for Malcolm MacLeod was made prisoner some time in
July 1746, ff. 251, 309.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>, A.M.</p></div>

volunteer. His father, James Gordon, was an officer in the Prince's army. In
the <cite>List of Persons concerned in the Rebellion, etc.</cite> (Scot. Hist. Soc., vol. viii.),
he is said to have been <em>made prisoner at Carlisle</em>. But a story is told of his
having been captured at his own house, when, after lurking long among the
neighbouring hills, he ventured to pass a night there. His captors, not being
sure of his identity, carried him before the minister of the parish, but not getting
satisfaction from him, they took him to a farmhouse where his wife and children
resided. On his approach his children ran out and greeted him with cries of
'Daddy! Daddy!' and so unwittingly sealed their father's fate. He was tried
at Carlisle and executed there on 15th November 1746. As the prisoners taken
at Carlisle were sent to London, and those taken in Scotland to Carlisle, the
story may be authentic.</p></div>

Abbey at Edinburgh, and I have heard some affirm, who had an opportunity of
knowing, that these were owing to the haughty, restless, unaccountable temper of
Lord George Murray, some of whose blood-relations fail not to lay blame upon
him. Witness likewise the contest betwixt Keppoch and Lochiel about the
right hand before they went out to fight Cope, a particular account of which
dispute I had from Major MacDonald in the Castle of Edinburgh.

always thwarted in them, and hardly got his will in anything he proposed, though
his opinion of things in the event turned out to be the most eligible. Lord
George Murray was at the head of the opposition, having got the ascendant of
the greater part of the chiftains, and having insinuated himself into the good
graces of all the clans who were ever ready to embrace his schemes. Besides,
it was most unlucky that great jealousies and misunderstandings had arisen
betwixt Lord George Murray and the French officers. These things are too
notour to admit of any denial.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>, A.M.</p></div>

(as I have often heard) were such infamous thieves and noted lifters of cattle, in
a word, such remarkable banditti by profession, that the country people who
knew them would not drink with them. And yet they proved most faithful and
trusty friends to the Prince in his greatest dangers and distresses. These very
men (consider and wonder!) that could at any time risque both body and soul
for less than the value of a single shilling, were found proof of <em>thirty thousand
pounds sterling</em>, and generously despised the tempting bait, whilst others (gentlemen
by birth, improved by a proper education) greedily sought after it. This is
a most surprising instance of fidelity and heroic virtue!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>, A.M.</p></div>

Benbecula, but I could never meet with any one that could give me an answer.
I then begged him to satisfie me as to that. He answered that he looked upon
Benbecula as a corruption of the original, which in Erse was Beinnmhaol (as
to the true just spelling) but Beinviol (as to the vulgar way of spelling), <em>i.e.</em> a

On the inside of the back board there is one piece of wood, an inch long by
about <sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>8</small></sub> broad and <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>8</small></sub> thick (and there has been another piece, but now it is
not) and underneath is written:&mdash;

The above are pieces of that identical eight-oar'd boat, on board of which
Donald Macleod, etc., set out from Boradale on the continent with the Prince
(after the battle of Culloden) for Benbecula in the Long Isle. The above pieces
were sent to me from Major MacDonald of Glenaladale to the care of Captain
Alexander MacDonald in Edinburgh, brother-german to Dalely. The said
Alexander MacDonald delivered the above pieces to me on Wednesday evening,
December 28th, 1748, he having come under a promise upon our first acquaintance
to procure me a bit of the eight-oar'd boat. See vol. 2, ff. 270, 284,
vol. 3, ff. 581, 582. Vol. 4, ff. 677, 678.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>, A.M.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_356_356" id="Footnote_356_356"></a><a href="#FNanchor_356_356"><span class="label">[356]</span></a> The affair of the Prince's sending expresses to Lochiel, and of Lochiel's
sending proper persons to seek out the Prince, and at last of their meeting together
as they both intended, appears to me not to be so distinctly and accurately
narrated in this Journal as in that of Mr. John Cameron [See ff. 173-179]. As
I have made some enquiry into this matter, I shall note down all I have discovered
about it as exactly as possible. Dr. Archibald Cameron (Lochiel's
brother) and Mr. John Cameron (late Presbyterian chaplain at Fort William)
were the persons despatched by Lochiel to use all the endeavours they could to
find out the Prince, in which they were happily successful. Lochiel was by this
time recovered of his wounds [See f. 1479] as is evident from Dr. Stewart Threpland's
leaving him and making his way to Edinburgh in the habit and character
of a Presbyterian probationer, in the month of July, long before the Prince and
Lochiel could meet. The foresaid Mr. John Cameron was the person dispatched
by Lochiel (after meeting with the Prince) to Edinburgh in order to hire a vessel
to take him and whom he should bring along with him off the east coast. Mr.
Cameron (by the assistance of proper friends) succeeded in this negotiation, as is
well known to some. But when he returned to inform the Prince of his success,
he, with Lochiel, etc., had set out for the place where the French were landed
upon the west coast to take off the Prince, etc. So that Mr. Cameron was left
to shift for himself. He made his way back to Edinburgh in disguise, and at
last got off under a borrowed name in the same coach with Lady Lochiel and
her children for London, the lady passing under the name of Mrs. Campbell, for
she could have no pass. They all got safely to France. When I happened to
be conversing with John Cameron, uncle of the said Mr. Cameron, in Edinburgh
[See f. 558], he told me that he himself attended Lochiel in his skulking.
I told him it was surprizing to me how any person could find out the Prince
when the ship landed in the west, because he was so far down the country in his
way southward, and then asked him if he could inform me what miles the Prince
might be from the ships when notice came to him. He said that he himself was
then on an errand enquiring about some of the distressed gentlemen, but that he
was persuaded the Prince was no less than 60 miles from the ships in a direct
line over the tops of hills, etc., as by that time he behoved to be in the confines
or in the county of Athol. I said no doubt he meant Highland miles. He said
he meant so, for that it would be no less than 70 or 80 ordinary miles; and if
one was to travell it by the common roads [See f. 1475], it would make no less
than 90 or 100. The indemnity did not make John Cameron (the uncle) safe,
because he had carried arms abroad in the first Highland regiment, and when the
Prince landed had a pension from Chelsea. He got off to Holland, and from
thence to France. He said the Prince, when skulking, used to retire some time
morning and evening by himself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Forbes</span>, A.M.</p></div>

the Prince arrived in France on the 29th or 30th of September, having set
sail from Scotland on the 20th of said month. [See ff. 522, 1476.]

<p><a name="Footnote_385_385" id="Footnote_385_385"></a><a href="#FNanchor_385_385"><span class="label">[385]</span></a> Here Colonel Ker vindicates Lord George Murray from villainy, an imputation
which no man in his right senses could ever entertain against Lord George,
because no villain would have exposed his person so remarkably as he did where
danger called upon all occasions. Besides, if Lord George had acted the double
and dishonest part, why should he have skulked, and, at last, have gone to
foreign parts? But, then, it is worth noticing that Colonel Ker says not a word
with respect to the insolence and haughtiness of Lord George's temper, his great
misfortune and fault, in which alone he can be justly blamed, and with which he
stands charged by the Prince's own words to more than one [see ff. 150, 236,
450, 453]. However, to do Lord George justice, it is affirmed by some who
have an opportunity of knowing, that Lord George, before he left Scotland, did
declare his surprize to a friend (Murray of Abercairney) how it could enter into
the head of any person to charge him with treachery. But at the same time that
he acknowledged with concern and regret that he had been too often guilty of
contradicting and thwarting the Prince in the measures he proposed. Certainly,
tho' both be bad enough, there is a great difference 'twixt villainy and pride.

cleared up by Donald MacLeod himself (See f. 289), and that, too, according to
the expressions of Captain John Hay upon the head who could have no interest
or by-view in what he spoke. See f. 479.&mdash;F.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_409_409" id="Footnote_409_409"></a><a href="#FNanchor_409_409"><span class="label">[409]</span></a> Four days and four nights, says Donald MacLeod, and not in so very great
misery as Captain O'Neille represents them to have been in, though indeed
their case was bad enough (See ff. 291-297). And Ned Burk's account of this
matter agrees with that of Donald MacLeod (See f. 331). One day I read this
particular of the desert island to Ned Burk when he used this remarkable
expression, 'What deel needs a man mack mair wonders than we had. Faith
we had anew o' them.' Words tho' coarse, yet very significant.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert

declare more than once that the Captain came to her (bringing the
Prince along with him) when she happened to be in a shealling belonging to her
brother; that the Captain was the contriver of the scheme, and that she herself
was very backward to engage in it; and indeed no wonder (whatever some may
say), when one seriously considers the important trust, and the many dangers
attending it. Something of all this may be gathered from her own Journal.
